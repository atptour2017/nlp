The United Nations is an international organization founded in 1945 after the Second World War by 51 countries committed to maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations and promoting social progress, better living standards and human rights. 
The UN has 4 main purposes 
To keep peace throughout the world; 
To develop friendly relations among nations; 
To help nations work together to improve the lives of poor people, to conquer hunger, disease and illiteracy, and to encourage respect for each other's rights and freedoms; 
To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve these goals. 
Due to its unique international character, and the powers vested in its founding Charter, the Organization can take action on a wide range of issues, and provide a forum for its 193 Member States to express their views, through the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and other bodies and committees. 
The work of the United Nations reaches every corner of the globe. 
Although best known for peacekeeping, peacebuilding, conflict prevention and humanitarian assistance, there are many other ways the United Nations and its System (specialized agencies, funds and programmes) affect our lives and make the world a better place. 
The Organization works on a broad range of fundamental issues, from sustainable development, environment and refugees protection, disaster relief, counter terrorism, disarmament and non-proliferation, to promoting democracy, human rights, gender equality and the advancement of women, governance, economic and social development and international health, clearing landmines, expanding food production, and more, in order to achieve its goals and coordinate efforts for a safer world for this and future generations.

The Secretariat — an international staff working in duty stations around the world — carries out the diverse day-to-day work of the Organization. 
It services the other principal organs of the United Nations and administers the programmes and policies laid down by them. 
At its head is the Secretary-General, who is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council for a five-year, renewable term. 
The duties carried out by the Secretariat are as varied as the problems dealt with by the United Nations. These range from administering peacekeeping operations to mediating international disputes, from surveying economic and social trends and problems to preparing studies on human rights and sustainable development. 
Secretariat staff also inform the world's communications media about the work of the United Nations; 
organize international conferences on issues of worldwide concern; 
and interpret speeches and translate documents into the Organization's official languages. 
As of 30 June 2010, the Secretariat had some 44,000 staff members around the world1. 
As international civil servants, staff members and the Secretary-General answer to the United Nations alone for their activities, and take an oath not to seek or receive instructions from any Government or outside authority. 
Under the Charter, each Member State undertakes to respect the exclusively international character of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the staff and to refrain from seeking to influence them improperly in the discharge of their duties. 
The United Nations, while headquartered in New York, maintains a significant presence in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Beirut, Geneva, Nairobi, Santiago and Vienna, and has offices all over the world. The UN currently has 15 peace operations, deployed on four continents. Serving the cause of peace in a violent world is a dangerous occupation.

FROM GLOBAL COMMITMENT TO NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION 
Status 
The Trusteeship Council suspended operation on 1 November 1994, with the independence of Palau, the last remaining United Nations trust territory, on 1 October 1994. 
By a resolution adopted on 25 May 1994, the Council amended its rules of procedure to drop the obligation to meet annually and agreed to meet as occasion required -- by its decision or the decision of its President, or at the request of a majority of its members or the General Assembly or the Security Council. 
Background 
In setting up an International Trusteeship System, the Charter established the Trusteeship Council as one of the main organs of the United Nations and assigned to it the task of supervising the administration of Trust Territories placed under the Trusteeship System. 
Major goals of the System were to promote the advancement of the inhabitants of Trust Territories and their progressive development towards self-government or independence. 
TheTrusteeship Council is made up of the five permanent members of the Security Council --China, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and United States. 
The aims of the Trusteeship System have been fulfilled to such an extent that all Trust Territories have attained self-government or independence, either as separate States or by joining neighbouring independent countries. 
Functions and powers 
Under the Charter, the Trusteeship Council is authorized to examine and discuss reports from the Administering Authority on the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the peoples of Trust Territories and, in consultation with the Administering Authority, to examine petitions from and undertake periodic and other special missions to Trust Territories.

UN and Civil Society 
"Our times demand a new definition of leadership - global leadership. 
They demand a new constellation of international cooperation - governments, civil society and the private sector, working together for a collective global good." 
Davos, Switzerland (29 January 2009) The United Nations is both a participant in and a witness to an increasingly global civil society. 
More and more, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other civil society organizations (CSOs) are UN system partners and valuable UN links to civil society. 
CSOs play a key role at major United Nations Conferences and are indispensable partners for UN efforts at the country level. 
NGOs are consulted on UN policy and programme matters. 
The UN organizes and hosts, on a regular basis, briefings, meetings and conferences for NGO representatives who are accredited to UN offices, programmes and agencies. 
The NGO Section of the Department of Public Information oversees partnerships with associated NGOs and provides a wide range of information services to them. 
These include weekly NGO briefings, communication workshops, an annual NGO conference and an annual orientation programme for newly associated NGOs.

DPI/NGO Annual Conference ECOSOC resolution calling on DPI to associate NGOs The UN Democracy Fund was established by the Secretary-General in July 2005 as a UN General Trust Fund. Supported by 36 Member States, its chief function is funding projects that strengthen the voice of civil society in democratic processes around the world. 
The large majority of UNDEF funds go to local civil society organizations -- both in the transition and consolidation phases of democratization. 
Over 13,000 CSOs have established a relationship with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA). 
The vast majority of these CSOs are NGOs; there are also institutions, foundations, associations and almost 1,000 Indigenous Peoples Organizations (IPOs) listed as CSOs with DESA - which maintains a database of registered CSOs. 
Once registered with DESA, CSOs can also apply for consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). 
If consultative status with ECOSOC is granted, the organization can participate in relevant international conferences convened by the United Nations and in meetings of the preparatory bodies of these conferences. CSO Net - Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Civil Society Network

"Never before have so many leaders, from so many countries and fields, agreed to work together to improve nutrition," said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 
2012 World Water Day: target 7. C of the MDGs met before the 2015 deadline 
In the lead-up to Rio+20, the 2012 World Water Day emphasized the importance of universal access to water to all to end famine, drought and political instability. 
It also marked the achievement of MDG target 7.c (halving the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water) making it amongst the first MDG targets to be met, well in advance of the 2015 deadline. 
2012 International Women's Day: 
"Empower Rural Women – End Hunger and Poverty" On the occasion of International Women's Day UN officials such as UN Secretary-General, or Michelle Bachelet, head of UN Women, stressed that women's participation in all aspects of society was more important than ever, as witnessed last year in the context of the global economic crisis, political transitions in the Arab world and elsewhere, and environmental disasters. 
MDGs: Encouraging results Despite remaining challenges, encouraging results regarding decline of extreme poverty, a better access to water, progress in combating tuberculosis and malaria, as well as a better gender parity in primary school enrolment were pointed out by the UN Secretary-General at a press conference he gave with Rebeca Grynspan of UNDP and Special Adviser Jeffrey Sachs. 
"These are major achievements. 
The MDGs brought not only better results but also better ways of measuring that have led to greater accountability", he said. 
World Bank's new data shows drop in extreme poverty despite persisting vulnerabilities In every region of the developing world, the percentage of people living on less than $1.25 a day and the number of poor declined between 2005-2008, according to estimates released by the World Bank. 
This across-the-board reduction over a three-year monitoring cycle marks a first since the Bank began monitoring extreme poverty. 
"We are now confident that the developing world has reached the first of the Millennium Goals " said Martin Ravallion, director of the World Bank's research group and lead author of the report. 
Hundreds of millions of children in cities across the world are growing up in poverty and enduring deprivation, according to UNICEF's "State of the World's Children 2012". Despite growing up in close proximity to modern facilities and basic services, many children in urban areas lack access to electricity, clean water and education. They are also at high risk of contracting diseases due to unsanitary conditions and suffering from malnutrition, the report highlights. Launch of UN International Year of Sustainable Energy for All 
As billions of people worldwide still lack access to modern energy, the UN launched the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All and called on governments, the private sector and civil society to help expand energy access, improve efficiency and increase the use of renewables. 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed that energy is central to everything, from powering economies to achieving the MDGs. 
"It is the golden thread that connects economic growth, increased social equity and preserving the environment," he said during the launch in Abu Dhabi on 16 January 2012. 
Countries meeting in Durban, South Africa, have delivered a breakthrough on the future of the international community's response to climate change, whilst recognizing the urgent need to raise their collective level of ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep the average global temperature rise below two degrees Celsius. 
Secretary-General Ban said the new accord was "essential for stimulating greater action and for raising the level of ambition and the mobilization of resources to respond to the challenges of climate change." 
World AIDS Day, end to epidemic is within reach ? "The progress we have made so far is proof that we can realize our vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths," said the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as the UN marked World AIDS Day on 1 December. 
A new report by UNAIDS released on 21 November shows that 2011 was a game changing year for the AIDS response with unprecedented progress in science, political leadership and results. 
The UN Climate Change Conference kicked off in Durban, South Africa, with thousands of representatives from governments, NGOs and civil society in order to advance ways to cut global carbon emissions and pollution and determine the future of the Kyoto Protocol. 
The outcome of the Conference is also likely to influence the upcoming Rio+20 conference on sustainable development to be held in Rio in June 2012. 
International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women at the UN highlights youth leadership UN officials called for engaging all of society, and especially young people, to end violence against women, a scourge that spans the globe and takes many forms, including rape, domestic violence and harassment at work. 
"Our challenge," said the UN Secretary-General, "is to ensure that the message of 'zero tolerance' is heard far and wide. 
To do that, we must engage all of society – and especially young people – and in particular young men and boys." 
Events to mark the International Day were held in New York and worldwide thanks to the network of UN Information Centres. 
Rio+20: launch of a global conversation on sustainability In the lead-up to Rio+20, the UN launched a campaign to invite people everywhere to engage in a global conversation about the future they want and to share their visions through the campaign's social media platforms. 
All the inputs received will be combined to form an exhibit at the conference in June 2012 in Rio de Janeiro. 
"The Rio+20 conference offers us a unique chance to […] visualize and plan for the future we want" said the UN Secretary-General at the launch event. 
Environmental problems threaten human development progress, UN report says 
The annual UNDP Human Development Report was released on 2 November. In the lead-up to Rio+20, the upcoming UN conference on sustainable development, this year's edition entitled Sustainability and Equity: A Better Future for All focuses on the link between human development and environmental sustainability. 
The report calls for urgent action to slow climate change, prevent further degradation and reduce inequalities as environmental deterioration threatens to reverse recent progress in human development for the world's poorest. 
challenges and call to action 
Top United Nations officials marked the global population reaching 7 billion with a call to action to world leaders to meet the challenges that a growing population poses, from ensuring adequate food and clean water to guaranteeing equal access to security and justice. 
"Today, we welcome baby 7 billion. 
In doing so we must recognize our moral and pragmatic obligation to do the right thing for him, or for her," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at a press event at UN Headquarters to mark the milestone. International Year of Cooperatives kickoff 
The United Nations launched the International Year of Cooperatives under the theme "Cooperative Enterprises Build a Better World", in recognition of their contribution to socio-economic development and achievement of the MDGs. 
The year aims at expanding public awareness of the role of cooperatives and encouraging their growth worldwide. 
"Cooperatives focus on the long-term," said Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro. 
"Through their use of local labour and capital, as well as their respect for the environment, cooperatives strengthen local economies while creating a sustainable future."

"We can meet the challenges we face. 
We can overcome them by putting people at the centre of our work," said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his message. On World Food Day, a concerted effort to address root causes of hunger 
For World Food Day (16 October), the UN agencies focus on the need to ensure that children have enough to eat, and address the factors that make food unaffordable for so many. "I urge world leaders in rich and poor countries alike to invest the energy and resources necessary to win the battle against hunger — a key pillar of our efforts to achieve the MDGs," said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his message. 
UN Advocates agree to targeted actions to support the MDGs Meeting on the margins of the 66th UN General Assembly, the MDG Advocates endorsed an action plan that encourages each advocate to champion at least one of the specific MDG initiatives that are grouped in two thematic clusters: food security and sustainable growth; and education and health. 
Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro welcomed "the important leadership, passion and expertise" provided by the Advocacy Group and noted that "targeted interventions" in support of individual Goals would foster real progress. 
Millennium Villages, on track to reach 2015 goals, launch final phase The Millennium Villages Project, a science-based partnership between academia, business and UN agencies to achieve the MDGs moves into the next – and final – phase with new pledges announced at the UN. By helping the rural poor escape poverty and ensure that communities are on track to self-sufficiency by 2015, this new step will improve the living standards of an estimated half a million people across Africa. 
The United Nations paid tribute to late Nobel laureate, UN supporter and MDG advocate Wangari Maathai, one of Africa's foremost environmental campaigners. 
Maathai was a "pioneer in articulating the links between human rights, poverty, environmental protection and security," said Ban Ki-moon. Every Woman Every Child- One year progress update 
A one-year progress update "Saving the Lives of 16 Million", launched on 20 September 2011 at the UN, showed that in the first year of the effort, commitments have been implemented and enhanced, new partners have come on board and funding has been increased. 
While lauding this progress, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted that millions of women and children are still dying and called for advancing the goal of saving 16 million lives by 2015. Governments Line up at UN in Support of International Push on Maternal, Child Malnutrition 
One year after the launch of the Scale Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, a global initiative that aims to improve maternal and child nutrition, representatives of governments, civil society and the private sector joined United Nations agencies to emphasize the importance of good nutrition, especially for mothers and infants during the 1,000 days between pregnancy and age 2. 
"The lives of millions of children are at stake. 
We can help them realize their physical and intellectual potential," Mr. Ban told the meeting. High-level meeting to reverse desertification Over 12 million hectares of productive land are lost due to desertification every year and two billion people live on drylands, according to the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). 
Participants in a high-level United Nations meeting on 20 September 2011 highlighted the need to reverse desertification to help reduce poverty and improve development prospects. 
"By refocusing our development agenda to include the potential of drylands, we can break the links between poverty and desertification, drought and land degradation," said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 
Listen to Ban Ki-moon's remarks. 
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are estimated to cause 63 per cent of all deaths worldwide, were the focus of a two-day UN high-level General Assembly meeting which resulted in a declaration calling for a multi-pronged campaign by governments, industry and civil society to prevent and control NCDs. 
"Non-communicable diseases are a threat to development. 
NCDs hit the poor and vulnerable particularly hard, and drive them deeper into poverty," said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 
Global Partnership for Development: it's "Time to Deliver", UN report says 
Economic troubles make delivery on anti-poverty commitments even more urgent to achieve the MDGs, according to the MDG Gap Task Force Report 2011. But support from donors, although up sharply since the inauguration of the MDGs in the year 2000, nonetheless is falling short of agreed targets. "Certainly the global economic outlook remains sobering. But this cannot be an excuse not to deliver. 
We cannot afford to leave the poor even further behind," said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who launched the UN's MDG Gap Task Force report in New York. 
"With effort and solidarity, we can close the gaps identified in this new report. 
I urge all world leaders to give it their close attention," he added. 
Watch the statement of the Secretary-General for the launch of the MDG Gap Task Force Report 2011 in New York on 16 September.

It is a challenge, an opportunity and a call to action for all of us," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told a panel discussion at the launch ceremony at UN Headquarters in New York. Record success against malaria, efforts must be sustained to win the battle 
The world has made remarkable gains against malaria in the past ten years, as stated in a report released by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM), saving the lives of more than one million people, mostly children, through the efforts of a United Nations-led global partnership. But more remains to be done as Ban Ki-moon cautioned: 
"Although the successes of recent years are remarkable, they need to be sustained and expanded, to prevent the disease from resurging." 2011 International Literacy Day celebrates peace 
This year's International Literacy Day, celebrated world-wide on 8 September, focused on the link between literacy and peace. 
Illiteracy continues to afflict nearly 800 million people unable to read or write, especially women and girls. 
"Literacy unlocks the capacity of individuals to imagine and create a more fulfilling future" said the UN Secretary-General. 
The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) marked the day with several initiatives. 
"The world urgently needs increased political commitment to literacy backed by adequate resources to scale up effective programmes," UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said in a message. 
Funding disbursements from donor governments for the AIDS response fell in 2010, dropping 10% from the previous year's level, according to an annual funding analysis conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). 
"AIDS is a smart investment even in this difficult economic environment. We have to look beyond the near-term costs and recognize the long-term benefits," said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS. 
"Donors need to make and follow through on commitments today to reduce costs in the future," he added. 
Organizations can make a significant contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals through their procurement choices, according to UNOPS' new Procurement and the Millennium Development Goals report which is a supplement to the 2010 Annual Statistical Report on United Nations Procurement.

World Population Day: 
This World Population Day (11 July) falls in a milestone year, when we anticipate the birth of the Earth's seven billionth inhabitant. "This is an opportunity to celebrate our common humanity and our diversity. It is also a reminder of our shared responsibility to care for each other and our planet," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. 
In a world that is more interconnected than ever before, challenges such as poverty, inequality, women's rights, aging, and the environment belong to all of us. That's why UNFPA and partners are launching a campaign called 7 Billion Actions. 
It aims to engage people, spur commitment and spark actions related to the opportunities and challenges presented by a world of 7 billion people. Major progress towards Millennium Development Goals, but the most vulnerable are left behind, UN report says 
Significant strides have been made towards the Millennium Development Goals, yet reaching all the goals by the 2015 deadline remains challenging, as the world's poorest are being left behind, according to the MDG Report 2011, the UN's annual progress report. 
"The MDGs have helped lift millions of people out of poverty, save countless children's lives and ensure that they attend school," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. 
"At the same time, we still have a long way to go in empowering women and girls, promoting sustainable development, and protecting the most vulnerable." 
Watch or read the statement of the Secretary-General for the launch of the UN Millennium Development Goals Report 2011 in Geneva on 7 July 2011.

the drive to 2015 aims to mobilize political will and resources to expand sanitation across the globe. "It is time to put sanitation and access to proper toilets at the centre of our development discussions," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. 
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro stressed the need to protect development gains achieved so far despite the fiscal austerity measures undertaken in the wake of the global financial crisis, saying great social benefits arise from investing in poverty eradication programmes. 
The Development Dialogue focused on women's and children's health and on strategies toward 2015 and beyond. World leaders set bold new AIDS targets Thirty years into the AIDS epidemic, world leaders came together to review progress and chart the future course of the global AIDS response at a High-level Meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York on 8–10 June. 
UNAIDS estimates that 34 million people are living with HIV and nearly 30 million people have died of AIDS-related causes since the first case of AIDS was reported on 5 June 1981. 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged ministers from around the world to "act boldly" to meet the social and economic targets known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
We must live up to the promises we made at the turn of the millennium," he said in a video message to an MDG meeting in Tokyo. 
New global partnership for women's and girls' education 
About 39 million adolescent girls are missing out on an education, and two thirds of the world's 796 million illiterate adults are women. 
"Better Life, Better Future" -- a new global initiative led by UNESCO -- focuses on reaching illiterate or semi-literate adolescent girls and expanding women's literacy programmes. 
"Investing in the education of women and girls anywhere brings huge returns for health and great benefits for society," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. 
Visiting health workers in Ethiopia, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spotlighted the progress made in improving the health of women and children, while also stressing the need to do more. 
"We have seen so many women and children dying needlessly from preventable diseases," Mr. Ban said. 
"Training good health workers, training good midwives can save a lot of women's and also children's lives." 
In Nigeria, he commended the government for investing in women's and children's health.

Sixteen countries announced new commitments to dramatically reduce maternal, newborn and child mortality, as part of the UN Secretary-General's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health. 
"Political and financial support for action on women's and children's health is reaching new and encouraging heights,'' said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is leading the Every Woman Every Child campaign to accelerate progress on Millennium Development Goals 4 (child mortality) and 5 (maternal health). 
World Malaria Day -- A day to act 
25 April is devoted to the fight against malaria, which afflicts as many as half a billion people, mainly in Africa, and kills a child every 45 seconds. 
"On World Malaria Day this year, there is much to celebrate," said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 
But "to reach our goal of near zero deaths from malaria by 2015, we need an extraordinary intensification of our actions."

As the world's only truly universal global organization, the United Nations has become the foremost forum to address issues that transcend national boundaries and cannot be resolved by any one country acting alone. To its initial goals of safeguarding peace, protecting human rights, establishing the framework for international justice and promoting economic and social progress, in the six and a half decades since its creation the United Nations has added on new challenges, such as climate change, international terrorism and AIDS. 
While conflict resolution and peacekeeping continue to be among its most visible efforts, the UN, along with its specialized agencies, is also engaged in a wide array of activities to improve people's lives around the world – from disaster relief, through education and advancement of women, to peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
This website offers an overview of some of these global issues, and links to other resources where you can get additional information.

Other Recent Publications World Urbanization Prospects, the 2011 Revision Posted on 25 April 2012 By 2050, some 9.3 billion people would inhabit the planet, more than two thirds of them in urban areas. 
Both continents will require very significant economic growth, expand urban infrastructure (transportation, water, energy, etc), improve housing, schools and public health services to accommodate the urban explosion due both to the burgeoning number of people born in their cities as well as to the influx of migrants from rural areas. 
Youth Perspectives on the Pursuit of Decent Work in Changing Times", outlines the situation of young people in the labour market and youth employment trends. In the aftermath of the economic crisis, the global youth unemployment rate saw its largest annual increase on record in 2009, resulting in around 75.8 million unemployed youth. 
This first report, entitled "The Changing Nature of Parliamentary Representation", is a joint work of the IPU and UNDP, and draws on input from 73 parliaments. 
It analyzes changes in relations between parliaments and citizens, and suggests improvements to parliamentary strategies for meeting public expectations.

Beyond New York, the initiative should include the other United Nations headquarters and offices around the globe." 
Speech on World Environment Day 2007 
The UN System's Footprint and Efforts to Reduce It (2011 edition) The report includes the details of the greenhouse gas emissions for 54 entities in 2010, as well as a breakdown of emissions by activity. It also details progress in reducing emissions and plans for the future. 
In 2007, on World Environment Day (5 June), Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, with the above words, made public his ambition to make the United Nations more efficient in its operations. 
In October 2007, at the meeting of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), the Executive Heads of UN agencies, funds and programmes committed to move their respective organizations towards climate neutrality, and developed the UN Climate Neutral Strategy. 
Specifically, they committed to: 
Estimate the greenhouse gas emissions of UN system organizations consistent with accepted international standards; 
Undertake efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; 
In the current renovation of UN Headquarters in New York , the 60-year-old original glass panels are being replaced with double-glazed panels. 
Energy consumption will be 50% lower than before. 
(UN Photo/Paulo Filgueiras) 
Analyze the cost implications and explore budgetary modalities of purchasing carbon offsets to eventually reach climate neutrality. 
The UN Climate Neutral Strategy highlights the advantages of harmonization. 
A common approach across the UN system brings greater impact, lowers transactions costs, facilitates practical action on the ground through the development of common tools, ensures comparability of data across organizations, and pooling of results for better-informed decisions and knowledge-sharing. 
Greenhouse gas emissions of UN organizations 
and what we are doing to reduce them 
The work to create a more sustainable UN is now coordinated through the Issue Management Group (IMG) on Sustainability Management, which is serviced by the Sustainable United Nations (SUN) facility and reports to the Environment Management Group (EMG). 
Throughout 2009, the EMG secretariat and SUN worked with the IMG focal points to develop the first generation of greenhouse gas inventories for each UN organization, using common methodologies, resources and training. 
The results of the process were published in December 2009 in Moving Towards a Climate Neutral UN. 
A breakdown of the results for each UN agency is also available here. 
In 2010, work continued to develop the second generation of greenhouse gas inventories and the first generation of emission reduction plans. 
Greening the Blue 
Greening the Blue is the official United Nations platform for raising awareness about the importance of sustainability within the UN system. 
The website highlights what has been achieved, what is happening next, and how UN staff can get involved. 
Aiming to improve communications on the UN system's sustainability performance, the website is a reservoir of useful information, including: 
The greenhouse gas inventories of most UN organizations; 
Case studies from different UN organizations on their internal sustainable activities; 
An animation showing how UN staff help create a more sustainable workplace; 
Resources containing tips and tools for the reduction of carbon footprint 
Greening the Blue is a one-stop shop for UN staff and the general public who have an interest in creating a more sustainable United Nations.

United Nations and the Rule of Law 
Promoting the rule of law at the national and international levels is at the heart of the United Nations' mission. 
Establishing respect for the rule of law is fundamental to achieving a durable peace in the aftermath of conflict, to the effective protection of human rights, and to sustained economic progress and development. 
The principle that everyone – from the individual right up to the State itself – is accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, is a fundamental concept which drives much of the United Nations work. 
The principle of the rule of law embedded in the Charter of the United Nations encompasses elements relevant to the conduct of State to State relations. 
The main United Nations organs, including the General Assembly and the Security Council, have essential roles in this regard, which are derived from and require action in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. 
"For the United Nations, the rule of law refers to a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. 
It requires, as well, measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness and procedural and legal transparency." 
(S/2004/616) Report of the Secretary-General on the Rule of Law and Transitional Justice in Conflict and Post-Conflict Societies 
The General Assembly has considered rule of law as an agenda item since 1992, with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions. (A/RES/61/39, A/RES/62/70, A/RES/63/128). 
The Security Council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law (S/PRST/2003/15, S/PRST/2004/2, S/PRST/2004/32, S/PRST/2005/30, S/PRST/2006/28) and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women, peace and security (SC res 1325, SC res. 1820), children in armed conflict (e.g., SC res 1612), the protection of civilians in armed conflict (e.g., SC res 1674). 
The Peacebuilding Commission has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda. 
The Organization includes judicial mechanisms, such as the International Court of Justice, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, and the ad hoc criminal tribunals and hybrid tribunals. 
UN activities 
UN rule of law activities support the development, promotion and implementation of international norms and standards in most fields of international law. 
The United Nations works to support a rule of law framework at the national level: a Constitution or its equivalent, as the highest law of the land; 
clear and consistent legal framework, and implementation thereof; 
strong institutions of justice, governance, security and human rights that are well structured, financed, trained and equipped; 
transitional justice processes and mechanisms; 
and a public and civil society that contributes to strengthening the rule of law and holding public officials and institutions accountable. 
These are the norms, policies, institutions and processes that form the core of a society in which individuals feel safe and secure, where disputes are settled peacefully and effective redress is available for harm suffered, and where all who violate the law, including the State itself, are held to account. 
Over 40 UN entities are engaged in rule of law issues and the Organization is conducting rule of law operations and programming in over 110 countries in all regions of the globe, with the largest presence in Africa. 
Many UN entities carry out activities in the same countries. 
Five or more entities are currently working simultaneously on the rule of law in at least 24 countries, the majority of which are in conflict and post-conflict situations. 
Efforts to Coordinate UN Rule of Law Activities 
UN Deputy 
Responsibility for the overall coordination of rule of law work rests with the Rule of Law Coordination and Resource Group, chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General and supported by the Rule of Law Unit. 
The membership of the Group consists of the Department of Political Affairs (DPA), the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). 
The Group has developed broad policy guidance to avoid duplication and maximize synergies, and is taking a new strategic and results-based approach to United Nations rule of law work. 
The Group has agreed a Joint Strategic Plan for 2009-2011 and has to date developed the following Guidance Notes of the Secretary General: UN Approach to Rule of Law Assistance, UN Approach to Justice for Children, and The United Nations and Constitution-making. The Rule of Law Coordination and Resource Group, supported by the Rule of Law Unit, is tasked with acting as a repository for the Organization's rule of law materials and best practices, and establishing and managing web resources. 
In fulfilling this mandate, the Group has developed the United Nations Rule of Law Website and Document Repository. Contact information

While the primary responsibility for the implementation of the Global Strategy rests with Member States, CTITF ensures that the UN system is attuned to the needs of Member States, to provide them with the necessary policy support and spread in-depth knowledge of the Strategy, and wherever necessary, expedite delivery of technical assistance. 
The primary goal is to maximize each entity's comparative advantage by delivering as one to help Member States implement the four pillars of the Strategy, which are: measures to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism; 
measures to prevent and combat terrorism; 
measures to build states' capacity to prevent and combat terrorism and to strengthen the role of the United Nations system in that regard; 
measures to ensure respect for human rights for all and the rule of law as the fundamental basis for the fight against terrorism. 
CTITF organizes its work through Working Groups and counter-terrorism related projects in areas where cooperation among United Nations system actors can add value for the implementation of the Strategy. 
"As we continue our work for the implementation of the Global Counter-terrorism Strategy, joining forces and strengthening cooperation is the key to our success. 
Governments are increasingly mobilizing in the fight against terrorism and we need to continue to work even more closely with United Nations Member States."

Uniting against Terrorism 
2005 World Summit 
All too often we are reminded that terrorism continues to inflict pain and suffering on people's lives all over the world. 
Almost no week goes by without an act of terrorism taking place somewhere in the world, indiscriminately affecting innocent people who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Countering this scourge is in the interest of all nations and the issue has been on the agenda of the United Nations for decades. 
Eighteen universal instruments (fourteen instruments and four amendments) against international terrorism have been elaborated within the framework of the United Nations system relating to specific terrorist activities. 
Member States through the General Assembly have been increasingly coordinating their counter-terrorism efforts and continuing their legal norm-setting work. 
The Security Council has also been active in countering terrorism through resolutions and by establishing several subsidiary bodies. 
At the same time a number of programmes, offices and agencies of the United Nations system have been engaged in specific activities against terrorism, further assisting Member States in their counter-terrorism efforts. 
To consolidate and enhance these activities, Member States in September 2006 embarked upon a new phase in their counter-terrorism efforts by agreeing on a global strategy to counter terrorism. 
The Strategy marks the first time that all Member States of the United Nations have agreed to a common strategic and operational framework to fight terrorism. 
The Strategy forms a basis for a concrete plan of action: to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism; 
to prevent and combat terrorism; 
to take measures to build state capacity to fight terrorism; 
to strengthen the role of the United Nations in combating terrorism; 
and to ensure the respect of human rights while countering terrorism. 
The Strategy builds on the unique consensus achieved by world leaders at their 2005 September Summit to condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. 
United Nations Commemorates the 10th Anniversary of 9/11 
The United Nations marked on 9 September 2011 the 10th anniversary of the 11 September attacks on the United States with a solemn commemoration in the General Assembly Hall, music, poetry and a vow to intensify the battle against terror wherever it is perpetrated in the world. 
"We want to be here to express our compassion and solidarity for all the victims of terrorist acts who are attacked randomly and without respite throughout the world. 
We are here to express our indignation at the cowardice of terrorism, condemn it firmly and categorically, combat it and see that the guilty are punished." 
– The President of the General Assembly 
"The attacks targeted more than one single country; they were an assault on humanity itself, and on the universal values of peace and dignity that the United Nations was created to promote and defend." 
– The Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations 
The Security Council also issued a Presidential statement: 
The members of the Security Council "reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivation, whenever and by whomsoever committed."

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asked young people from all over the world to "make some noise" to help accelerate progress on the negotiations of the United Nations Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20) which will take place in Brazil next month. "The truth is I am disappointed with the negotiations. They are not moving fast enough. That is why I need you," he said.

UN secures $40 billion for women's and children's health 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Heads of State and Government, along with the private sector, foundations, international organizations, civil society and research organizations, today kicked off a major concerted worldwide effort to accelerate progress on women's and children's health. 
With pledges of more than $40 billion over the next five years, the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health has the potential of saving the lives of more than 16 million women and children, preventing 33 million unwanted pregnancies, protecting 120 millions of children from pneumonia and 88 million children from stunting, advancing the control of deadly diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, and ensuring access for women and children to quality facilities and skilled health workers. 
"We know what works to save women's and children's lives, and we know that women and children are critical to all of the MDGs," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. 
"Today we are witnessing the kind of leadership we have long needed." 
"We must not fail the billions who look to the international community to fulfil the promise of the Millennium Declaration for a better world. 
Let us meet in September to keep the promise." -- UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon

Financial and Economic Crisis - United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 
Skip to main navigation Skip to content 
Africa 
The world economy is mired in the most severe financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression, which continues to threaten the ability of many countries to confront issues such as poverty, hunger and disease. 
As the crisis deepened, the impact on developing countries became rapidly worse, particularly in terms of rising unemployment and a widening external financing gap. 
A sharp decline in international trade flows, a collapse in commodity prices, a drop in international tourism and a moderation in remittances have contributed to a significant deterioration in the current account balances of many developing countries. 
Dialogue 
DESA plays a major convening role in supporting intergovernmental dialogue and co-ordinating courses of action that address the crisis. 
The Department serves as the Secretariat of the United Nations Conferences on Financing for Development and many of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council. 
DESA supported the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development which took place 24-30 June 2009 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. 
The Conference saw Member States gather and identify emergency and long-term responses to mitigate the impact of the crisis, especially on vulnerable populations. 
Outcome of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development Ad hoc open-ended working group to follow up on the issues contained in the Outcome of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development In addition, the various Commissions supported by DESA including the Commission for Social Development, the Commission on Sustainable Development, the Commission on the Status of Women and the Statistical Commission have discussed and examined the multifaceted and complex nature of the crisis. 
Research 
The Department also serves as a think tank within the United Nations in the area of economic and social affairs through its analysis, research and publications. 
Key economic policies are spelled-out in the flagship publication "World Economic Situation and Prospects" (WESP). 
DESA focuses in particular on countries with vulnerable economies, including Africa and Small Island Developing States, and continues to conduct analytical studies on the crisis to support intergovernmental consultations. 
The Department's research also addresses women's control over economic resources and access to financial aid. 
Generating high quality estimates of economic performance have become an essential output of DESA throughout the crisis. 
Additional indicators have been developed to assess the performance of economies and financial markets during this time. 
Capacity development 
DESA's capacity development interventions during the crisis have included the provision of supplementary macroeconomic advisory capacity (SMAC) to the Financial Crisis Working Group, as well as direct advice to developed countries. 
The Department has also assisted countries to understand and deal with the social and sustainable development dimensions of the crisis and helped countries enhance their statistical data gathering in general, and on the financial and social aspects of the crisis in particular. 
DESA draws on its extensive network of partners to provide capacity development services. 
The Department has also focused on the impact of external shocks on poverty and social vulnerability and assisted countries in macroeconomic policy analysis, in particular for the realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
The availability of MDG indicators and data has provided instruments for monitoring these trends for timely intervention and action. 
Furthermore, DESA supports the 2010 Population Census that will be conducted in most countries of the world, as its outcome will provide information on how migration, housing and employment were affected by the crisis.

UN General Assembly - Second Committee - Economic and Financial 
Second Committee 
Past Sessions 
Economic and Financial 
The Economic and Financial Committee (Second Committee), is chaired by H.E. Mr. Abulkalam Abdul Momen of Bangladesh. 
During this session, it will deal with issues relating to economic growth and development such as macroeconomic policy questions (including international trade, international financial system, and external debt sustainability), financing for development, sustainable development, human settlements, poverty eradication, globalization and interdependence, operational activities for development, and information and communication technologies for development. 
The Second Committee will also consider issues relating to Groups of Countries in special situations - such as the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs). 
It will also consider the item on permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources. 
At the sixty-fifth session, the Second Committee took action on 44 draft proposals. 
The Committee is expected to act on a similar number of proposals during this year's session. 
In accordance with the on-going process of revitalization of the General Assembly, the Second Committee is engaged in updating its working methods and practices in order to improve the quality of debates and the impact of their deliberations and decisions, as well as to further streamline the Committee's agenda and programme of work, biennialize agenda items, cluster the consideration of agenda items thematically, hold interactive "question time" sessions with secretariat officials after the presentation of substantive reports, and actively work to reduce the number and length of draft resolutions adopted during its sessions. 
As in previous sessions, the Committee will hold a dialogue with the Executive Secretaries of the Regional Commissions as well as schedule a number of side events as part of its programme of work.

Third Committee 
Social, Humanitarian & Cultural 
The Social, Humanitarian Cultural Affairs Commitee (Third Committee) of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, is chaired by H.E. Mr. Hussein Haniff of Malaysia. 
The General Assembly allocates to its Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Affairs Committee, commonly referred to as the "Third Committee", agenda items relating to a range of social, humanitarian affairs and human rights issues that affect people all over the world. 
As in previous sessions, an important part of the work of the Committee will focus on the examination of human rights questions, including reports of the special procedures of the Human Rights Council which was established in 2006. 
In October 2011, the Committee will hear and interact with 34 such special rapporteurs, independent experts, and chairs of working groups of the Human Rights Council. 
The Committee also discusses the advancement of women, the protection of children, indigenous issues, the treatment of refugees, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through the elimination of racism and racial discrimination, and the right to self- determination. 
The Committee also addresses important social development questions such as issues related to youth, family, ageing, persons with disabilities, crime prevention, criminal justice, and international drug control. 
At the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the Third Committee considered 56 draft resolutions, more than half of which were submitted under the human rights agenda item alone. These included three so-called country-specific resolutions on human rights situations. 
Under the chairmanship of H.E. Mr. Hussein Haniff, the Permanent Representative of Malaysia to the United Nations, the Third Committee is expected to consider a similar number of draft resolutions.

UN System 
The historic United Nations conferences and summits held in the 1990s and 2000s generated an unprecedented global consensus on a shared vision of development. 
That broad-based framework in turn laid the groundwork for the Millennium Summit, at which a series of challenging time-bound goals and targets were adopted. They were later collated as Millennium Development Goals, which have succeeded in galvanizing an exceptional momentum to meet the needs of the world's poorest. 
While the Millennium Development Goals provide a compelling platform to address those needs, they must be pursued as part of a larger development agenda that encompasses the wider dimensions of human development. 
The larger development agenda must equally address issues that require long-term approaches, such as, the differential impact of globalization, inequalities among and within countries, greater participation of developing countries in global economic governance, and the question of interlinkages between development and conflict. 
Those issues were addressed in depth at the United Nations summits and conferences, which provide a broad-based consensus to pursue the full scope of the United Nations Development Agenda. The agenda cuts across a vast array of interlinked issues ranging from gender equality, social integration, health, employment, education, the environment and population to human rights, finance and governance. 
The achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the implementation of the broader development agenda are closely interlinked. 
They will be ensured by effectively integrating the implementation of the conference outcomes with the Millennium Development Goals by focusing on issues that are closely linked with the Goals that cut across the conference outcomes.

United Nations: About Development 
Although most people associate the United Nations with the issues of peace and security, the vast majority of the Organization's resources are in fact devoted to advancing the Charter's pledge to "promote higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development". 
United Nations development efforts have profoundly affected the lives and well-being of millions of people throughout the world. 
Guiding the United Nations endeavours is the conviction that lasting international peace and security are possible only if the economic and social well-being of people everywhere is assured. 
Many of the economic and social transformations that have taken place globally since 1945 have been significantly affected in their direction and shape by the work of the United Nations. 
As the global centre for consensus-building, the UN has set priorities and goals for international cooperation to assist countries in their development efforts and to foster a supportive global economic environment. 
International debate on economic and social issues has increasingly reflected the commonality of interests between rich and poor countries in solving the many problems that transcend national boundaries. 
Issues such as refugee populations, organized crime, drug trafficking and AIDS are seen as global problems requiring coordinated action. 
The impact of persistent poverty and unemployment in one region can be quickly felt in others, not least through migration, social disruption and conflict. 
Similarly, in the age of a global economy, financial instability in one country is immediately felt in the markets of others. 
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is the principal body coordinating the economic and social work of the United Nations and its operational arms. 
It is serviced by the Department for Economic and Social Affairs. 
The entire family of United Nations organizations works for economic, social and sustainable development. 
Setting the agenda 
The UN has played a crucial role in building international consensus on action for development. 
Beginning in 1960, the General Assembly has helped set priorities and goals through a series of 10-year International Development Strategies. 
focusing on issues of particular concern, the Decades have consistently stressed the need for progress on all aspects of social and economic development. 
The UN continues formulating new development objectives in such key areas as sustainable development, the advancement of women, human rights, environmental protection and good governance – along with programmes to make them a reality. 
At the Millennium Summit in September 2000, world leaders adopted a set of 
Millennium Development Goals aimed at eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; 
achieving universal primary education; 
promoting gender equality and empowering women; 
reducing child mortality; 
improving maternal health; 
combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; 
and ensuring environmental sustainability — through a set 
of measurable targets to be achieved by the year 2015. 
Among these are: 
cutting in half the proportion of those who earn less than a dollar a day; 
eliminating gender disparity at all levels of education; 
dramatically reducing child mortality while increasing maternal health. In September 2008, Governments, foundations, businesses and civil society groups announced new commitments to meet the Millennium Development Goals at a high-level event at UN Headquarters. 
Assistance for development 
The UN system works in a variety of ways to promote economic and social goals. 
The mandates of the specialized agencies cover virtually all areas of economic and social endeavour. 
The agencies provide technical assistance and other forms of practical help to countries around the world. 
In cooperation with the UN, they help formulate policies, set standards and guidelines, foster support and mobilize funds. 
The World Bank, for example, provided more than $38.2 billion in development loans in fiscal year 2008 to nearly 100 developing countries. 
Close coordination between the UN and the specialized agencies is ensured through 
the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), comprising the Secretary-General, the heads of the specialized agencies, funds and programmes, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Trade Organization. 
The UN programmes and funds work under the authority of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council to carry out the UN's economic and social mandate. 
The UN Development Group, comprising the UN operational programmes and funds, enhances overall cooperation. 
The UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN's largest provider of grants for sustainable human development worldwide, is actively involved in attaining the Millennium Development Goals. 
The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) is the lead UN organization working for the long-term survival, protection and development of children. 
Active in nearly 160 countries and territories, its programmes focus on immunization, primary health care, nutrition and basic education. 
Many other UN programmes work for development, in partnership with governments and NGOs. 
The World Food Programme (WFP) is the world's largest international food aid organization for both emergency relief and development. 
The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) is the largest international provider of population assistance. 
The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) works to encourage sound environmental practices everywhere, and 
the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) assists people living in health-threatening housing conditions. 
To increase the participation of developing countries in the global economy, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) promotes international trade. 
also works with the World Trade Organization (WTO), a separate entity, in assisting developing countries' exports through the International Trade Centre. 
Pooling resources 
The UN system is increasingly pooling its efforts to tackle complex problems that cut across organizational areas of expertise and defy the efforts of any country acting alone. 
The Joint UN Programme on AIDS pools the expertise of eight UN agencies and programmes to combat an epidemic that currently affects some 33 million people worldwide. 
In 2007 alone, some 2 million people died of AIDS, while 2.7 million were newly infected with HIV. 
A Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, called for by the Secretary-General in 2001, is a partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector and affected communities. 
By 2009, it had committed some $15 billion in 140 countries to support aggressive interventions against these three diseases, which kill over 6 million people every year. 
Joint initiatives to expand immunization and develop new vaccines have enlisted the support of business leaders, philanthropic foundations, non-governmental organizations and governments, as well as UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank. 
The Global Environment Facility, a $3.1 billion fund administered by UNDP, UNEP and the World Bank, helps developing countries carry out environmental programmes. And the UN system works closely with the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), an African Union initiative that serves as a framework for international support for African development.

Human Rights Homepage 
Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, 
Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, 
Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law, 
Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations, 
Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, 
Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge, 
Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.

The General Assembly adopted by consensus the resolution titled "United against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance" (document A/66/L.2). 
On 22 September 2011, the United Nations General Assembly held a one day high-level meeting in New York to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
This document, which is the international community's blueprint for action to fight racism, was adopted by consensus at the 2001 UN World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance held in Durban, South Africa. 
It is an innovative and action oriented agenda to combat all forms of racism and racial discrimination. 
This 10th anniversary was a chance to strengthen political commitment in fighting racism and racial discrimination. 
Coming as it did during the 2011 International Year for People of African Descent, it reminded us about all victims identified in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and created another opportunity to focus on how to prevent and combat racism and racial discrimination in all its manifestations. 
At the opening plenary of the High-Level Meeting, world leaders adopted by consensus a political declaration proclaiming their "strong determination to make the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and the protection of the victims thereof, a high priority for [their] countries." 
See Closing Press Release 
The General Assembly meeting commemorating the 10th anniversary was a one-day event at the level of Heads of State and Government taking the form of a plenary session and a series of round table discussions. 
The arrangements for this anniversary meeting were handled by the President of the General Assembly, assisted by the Ambassadors of Cameroon and Monaco. 
The meeting opened at 9:00 a.m. on Thursday 22 September in the General Assembly hall at United Nations headquarters in New York. 
A short ceremonial opening was followed by two consecutive round tables from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. A closing plenary session took place from 6:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. where summaries of the round table discussions were presented. 
The theme for the anniversary event was: "Victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance: recognition, justice and development."

25th Anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development

The United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development unequivocally establishes development as a right and puts people at the centre of the development process. 
The groundbreaking document, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 4 December 1986, first proclaimed this inalienable right, declaring that everyone is "entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized." 
It belongs to everyone 
The pursuit of economic growth is not an end in itself. 
The Declaration clearly states that development is a comprehensive process aiming to improve "the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution" of the resulting benefits. 
Like all human rights, the right to development belongs to all individuals and peoples, everywhere, without discrimination and with their participation. 
The Declaration recognizes the right to self-determination and to full sovereignty over natural wealth and resources. 
25th anniversary 
This year marks the Declaration's 25th anniversary. 
Yet many children, women and men – the very subjects of development – still live in dire need of the fulfillment of their entitlement to a life of dignity, freedom and equal opportunity. 
This directly affects the realization of a wide range of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has called on governments and all concerned to seize the opportunity of this anniversary to move beyond political debate and focus on practical steps to implement the Declaration. 
"I am duty-bound to raise this anniversary call. 
We must end discrimination in the distribution of the benefits of development. 
We must stop the 500,000 preventable deaths of women in childbirth every year. 
We must free the millions of children from hunger in a world of plenty. 
And we must ensure that people can benefit from their country's natural resources and participate meaningfully in decision-making. 
These are the kind of issues addressed by the Declaration, which calls for equal opportunity and a just social order. … 
It's not an act of nature that leaves more than one billion people around the world locked in the jaws of poverty. It's a result of the denial of their fundamental human right to development."

Mission Statement 
The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide acts as a catalyst to raise awareness of the causes and dynamics of genocide, to alert relevant actors where there is a risk of genocide, and to advocate and mobilize for appropriate action. 
The Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect leads the conceptual, political, institutional and operational development of the Responsibility to Protect. 
The mandates of the two Special Advisers are distinct but complementary. 
The efforts of their Office include alerting relevant actors to the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, enhancing the capacity of the United Nations to prevent these crimes, including their incitement, and working with Member States, regional and sub-regional arrangements, and civil society to develop more effective means of response when they do occur. 
Preventing Genocide 
Francis M. Deng(UN Photo/Mark Garten) 
In 2004, following the genocidal violence in Rwanda and the Balkans, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Juan Méndez as Special Adviser to fill critical gaps in the international system that allowed those tragedies to go unchecked. 
In 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Francis M. Deng on a full-time basis at the level of Under-Secretary-General. He also appointed Edward Luck as the Special Adviser who focuses on the responsibility to protect, on a part-time basis at the level of Assistant Secretary-General. 
In a 2004 letter (S/2004/567) to the President of the Security Council, the Secretary-General listed the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide's responsibilities as follows: 
Collecting existing information, in particular from within the United Nations system, on massive and serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law of ethnic and racial origin that, if not prevented or halted, might lead to genocide; 
Acting as a mechanism of early warning to the Secretary-General, and through him to the Security Council, by bringing to their attention situations that could potentially result in genocide; 
Making recommendations to the Security Council, through the Secretary-General, on actions to prevent or halt genocide; 
Liaising with the United Nations system on activities for the prevention of genocide and work to enhance the United Nations' capacity to analyze and manage information regarding genocide or related crimes. 
Responsibility to Protect 
Edward Luck(UN Photo/Mark Garten) 
At the 2005 World Summit, Heads of State and Government unanimously affirmed that "each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity." 
They agreed that, when appropriate, the international community should assist States in exercising that responsibility by building their protection capacities before crises and conflicts break out. 
However, when a state is "manifestly failing" to protect its population from the four specified crimes, the Heads of State and Government confirmed that the international community was prepared to take collective action, through the Security Council and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. 
In his 2007 letter (S/2007/721) to the President of the Security Council, the Secretary-General recognizes the link between large scale atrocities and threats to peace and security. 
In this letter and in the Secretary-General's 2010 report (A/64/864) entitled "Early warning, assessment and the responsibility to protect", the Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect is charged with the development and refinement of the Responsibility to Protect concept and with continuing a political dialogue with Member States and other stakeholders on further steps toward implementation. 
For reasons of efficiency, the Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect is also charged with working with the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide to operationalize their complementary mandates within and outside of the United Nations System to have a greater impact.

Rights of the Child Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict 
Since the World Summit for Children, in 1990, the United Nations has increasingly sought to draw international attention to the horrendous plight of children affected by armed conflict. 
In 1996, Ms. Graça Machel, an independent expert appointed by the Secretary-General, submitted her report to the General Assembly entitled Impact of Armed Conflict on Children (A/51/306). 
The report led to the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 51/77 of 12 December 1996, establishing the mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict for a period of three years. 
The Assembly has since extended this mandate four times and most recently by its resolution A/RES/63/241 of 24 December 2008. 
In September 1997, the Secretary-General appointed Mr. Olara A. Otunnu as his Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict. 
Radhika Coomaraswamy has assumed this position since April 2006. 
The Mission Statement of the Office of the Special Representative is: 
"To promote and protect the rights of all children affected by armed conflict" 
The Special Representative serves as a moral voice and independent advocate for the protection and well-being of boys and girls affected by armed conflict. 
The Special Representative works with partners to propose ideas and approaches to enhance the protection of children and armed conflict and to promote a more concerted protection response. 
The Special Representative and her Office advocate, build awareness and give prominence to the rights and protection of children and armed conflict. 
The Special Representative is a facilitator, undertaking humanitarian and diplomatic initiatives to facilitate the work of operational actors on the ground with regard to children and armed conflict. 
The Office of the Special Representative does not have a field presence but promotes and supports the efforts of operational partners.

UN warns lack of funds threatens response to food crisis in Africa's Sahel region (10 April 2012) "My High-Level Task Force is working to ensure that the UN system, international financial institutions and the WTO are ready to provide robust and consistent support to countries struggling to cope with food insecurity. 
This is a long-term effort and it will require a comprehensive push to back solid partnerships, strong strategies and well-financed actions that empower communities to become food secure." 
The Task Force is chaired by the UN Secretary-General, with FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva serving as Vice-Chairman. 
Assistant Secretary-General David Nabarro was appointed Coordinator of the Task Force in January 2009. 
Secretary-General's remarks at High-Level Event on Scaling up Nutrition — UN Headquarters, New York, 20 September 2011 
Welcome, all of you: 
Nutrition leaders from across the UN system. 
Our valuable development partners, with your great expertise. 
Partners in civil society who reach out across communities. 
And executives from the private sector who take an interest in public health. 
One year ago, we launched this Scaling Up Nutrition Movement at an event co-hosted by the United States and Ireland. 
At that moment, we pledged to make a difference. 
Our message was clear and compelling. 
One thousand days: 
change a life, change the future. 
That day was the start of what we hope will be a profoundly important movement for change. 
Our meeting this year coincides with the first-ever United Nations High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases. 
Obesity and malnutrition may seem like polar opposites. 
But more and more countries are suffering from both. 
And the answer to both is better nutrition. 
Like so many other ailments, NCDs can have their roots in poor nutrition during infancy. 
The Scaling Up Nutrition initiative has support from more than 20 countries. 
They understand that food and nutrition security is a human right. 
They know that food and nutrition security drives economic, social and human development. 
And they have detailed plans for Scaling Up Nutrition. 
Over 100 agencies and organizations have endorsed the SUN Framework that sets out the Movement's approach. The lives of millions of children are at stake. We can help them realize their physical and intellectual potential. The magnitude of this problem is most obvious today in the Horn of Africa. 
Thirteen point five million people there desperately need food to survive. Without proper nutrition the children and pregnant mothers will suffer irreversible damage. 
That is why I am urgently appealing for leadership, funds and global solidarity. That is why we are here today. The SUN Movement brings together different partners to focus on one shared goal: the critical 1,000-day window between pregnancy and a child's second birthday. 
Proper nutrition at this time is the difference between health and sickness, thriving and deteriorating, life and death. 
The initiative is about supporting countries – improving nutritious diets, enhancing nutrition in pregnancy and promoting breastfeeding. 
It is also encouraging nutrition-sensitive strategies in many areas, including agriculture, social protection, education, employment and health. 
Countries in the SUN Movement will be accountable to those they seek to help. 
Different parts of the UN system – including the Standing Committee on Nutrition, the REACH partnership and our High Level Task Force on Global Food Security - are also accountable for supporting this effort. We plan to put SUN on a stronger footing. 
That is why I am counting on you to take a hard look at tasks which lie ahead. Over the course of a life, the first 1,000 days are all too brief and fleeting. We have to act before that window closes. We are here today to make the SUN of better nutrition rise over our entire world. 
Featured Article: Action Plan on Food Price Volatility and Agriculture The following commentary was prepared by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Food Security and Nutrition and Coordinator of the High Level Task Force (HLTF) on Food Security The French G20 presidency invited G20 Agriculture Ministers to meet in Paris on 23 June 2011. 
Ministers agreed an action plan on food price volatility and agriculture which focuses on stabilizing prices and increasing overall food supplies through sustainable investments in the production of nutritious foods. 
Their investments will make a comprehensive contribution to overall availability of food in the face of increasing demand, to improving people's food and nutrition security, and to reducing hunger. They agreed to remove food export restrictions or extraordinary taxes on food purchased for non-commercial humanitarian purposes by the World Food Programme: they also agreed not to impose them in the future. This was the first ever meeting of G20 Agriculture Ministers: 
it builds on a number of regional ministerial processes including the sequence of meetings sponsored by the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme and last years' agriculture ministers' meeting under the APEC framework in Japan.»

Speech on World Environment Day 2007 Moving Towards a Climate Neutral UN: The UN System's Footprint and Efforts to Reduce It (2011 edition) 
The report includes the details of the greenhouse gas emissions for 54 entities in 2010, as well as a breakdown of emissions by activity. It also details progress in reducing emissions and plans for the future. In 2007, on World Environment Day (5 June), Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, with the above words, made public his ambition to make the United Nations more efficient in its operations. 
In October 2007, at the meeting of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), the Executive Heads of UN agencies, funds and programmes committed to move their respective organizations towards climate neutrality, and developed the UN Climate Neutral Strategy. 
Specifically, they committed to: Estimate the greenhouse gas emissions of UN system organizations consistent with accepted international standards; 
Undertake efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; 
, the 60-year-old original glass panels are 
being replaced with double-glazed panels. 
Analyze the cost implications and explore budgetary modalities of purchasing carbon offsets to eventually reach climate neutrality. 
The UN Climate Neutral Strategy highlights the advantages of harmonization. 
A common approach across the UN system brings greater impact, lowers transactions costs, facilitates practical action on the ground through the development of common tools, ensures comparability of data across organizations, and pooling of results for better-informed decisions and knowledge-sharing. 
The work to create a more sustainable UN is now coordinated through the Issue Management Group (IMG) on Sustainability Management, which is serviced by the Sustainable United Nations (SUN) facility and reports to the Environment Management Group (EMG). Throughout 2009, the EMG secretariat and SUN worked with the IMG focal points to develop the first generation of greenhouse gas inventories for each UN organization, using common methodologies, resources and training. The results of the process were published in December 2009 in Moving Towards a Climate Neutral UN. A breakdown of the results for each UN agency is also available here. 
In 2010, work continued to develop the second generation of greenhouse gas inventories and the first generation of emission reduction plans. Greening the Blue Greening the Blue is the official United Nations platform for raising awareness about the importance of sustainability within the UN system. The website highlights what has been achieved, what is happening next, and how UN staff can get involved. 
Aiming to improve communications on the UN system's sustainability performance, the website is a reservoir of useful information, including: The greenhouse gas inventories of most UN organizations; Case studies from different UN organizations on their internal sustainable activities; An animation showing how UN staff help create a more sustainable workplace; 
Resources containing tips and tools for the reduction of carbon footprint 
Greening the Blue is a one-stop shop for UN staff and the general public who have an interest in creating a more sustainable United Nations.

International Day for Biological Diversity, 22 May 
International Day for Biological Diversity 
22 May 
Secretary-General's Message 
Convention on Biodiversity 
Previous Celebrations 
"Despite its importance, marine biodiversity — the theme of this year's International Day for Biological Diversity — has not fared well at human hands. 
Commercial over-exploitation of the world's fish stocks is severe. 
Many species have been hunted to fractions of their original populations" 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (2012) 
Theme 2012: 
The United Nations General Assembly, by its resolution 55/201 of 20 December 2000, proclaimed 22 May as The International Day for Biological Diversity, to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues. 
The date designated for the day was chosen to commemorate the adoption of the text of the Convention on 22 May 1992 by the Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity. 
The day was first created by the Second Committee of the UN General Assembly in late 1993, and the UN General Assembly, by its resolution 49/119 of 19 December 1994, designated December 29th (the date of entry into force of the Convention of Biological Diversity) the International Day for Biological Diversity. 
However, it was difficult for many countries to plan and carry out suitable celebrations for the date of 29 December, given the number of holidays that coincide around that time of year.

The International Day of Families is observed on the 15th of May every year. 
The Day was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in 1993 with resolution A/RES/47/237 and reflects the importance the international community attaches to families. 
The International Day provides an opportunity to promote awareness of issues relating to families and to increase knowledge of the social, economic and demographic processes affecting families. 
In its resolution, the General Assembly also noted that the family-related provisions of the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits of the 1990s and their follow-up processes continue to provide policy guidance on ways to strengthen family-centred components of policies and programmes as part of an integrated comprehensive approach to development. 
The International Day of Families has inspired a series of awareness-raising events, including national family days. 
In many countries, that day provides an opportunity to highlight different areas of interest and importance to families. 
Activities include workshops and conferences, radio and television programmes, newspaper articles and cultural programmes highlighting relevant themes.

"They will remember that we were sold, but not that we were strong. 
They will remember that we were bought, but not that we were brave." 
William Prescott, former slave 
The tragic transatlantic slave trade, which marked one of the darkest chapters in human history, lasted for 400 years, despite a spirited resistance by the millions of enslaved peoples. 
The transatlantic slave trade, often known as the triangular trade, connected the economies of three continents. 
It is estimated that between 15 to 20 million people, men, women and children, were deported from their homes and sold as slaves in the different slave trading systems. 
The yearly remembrance serves not only as an opportunity to reflect on those that suffered and perished at the hands of slavery, but also as an occasion to raise awareness to the world's youth about the dangers of racism and prejudice. 
This year's theme of "Honouring the Heroes, Resisters and Survivors" of the Transatlantic Slave Trade aims to pay tribute to the brave men and women who valiantly fought against the inhumane practices of slavery. 
Zumbi dos Palmares, Harriet Tubman and an anonymous slave (shown in the poster above), like so many others who struggled for freedom, represent the theme of this year's International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade. 
There are many more heroes who will be honoured during the commemoration.

International Day in Support of Victims of Torture 
26 June 
"At a time when the legitimate aspirations of people in many regions of the world for greater freedom, dignity and a better life are too often met with violence and repression, I urge States to respect the fundamental rights of all people. 
Torture and other forms of cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment and punishment, wherever they occur and whatever the circumstances, can never be justified." 
Message for the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture 2011 
Torture victim from Congo Brazaville, undergoing rehabilitation in Vivre-Caprec, a torture rehabilitation centre, in Senegal. The centre is funded by the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Torture. 
(OHCHR Photo) Torture seeks to annihilate the victim's personality and denies the inherent dignity of the human being. 
The United Nations has condemned torture from the outset as one of the vilest acts perpetrated by human beings on their fellow human beings. 
Torture is a crime under international law. 
According to all relevant instruments, it is absolutely prohibited and cannot be justified under any circumstances. 
This prohibition forms part of customary international law, which means that it is binding on every member of the international community, regardless of whether a State has ratified international treaties in which torture is expressly prohibited. 
The systematic or widespread practice of torture constitutes a crime against humanity. 
On 12 December 1997, by resolution 52/149, the UN General Assembly proclaimed 26 June the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, with a view to the total eradication of torture and the effective functioning of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, (resolution 39/46), annex, which entered into force on 26 June 1987.

"In a world of common challenges, no nation can succeed on its own; 
but by working together in common cause, we can build a safer, more prosperous future for all. 
Solidarity must be the foundation for global solutions. " 
Message for International Human Solidarity Day 20 December 2011 
The General Assembly, on 22 December 2005, by resolution 60/209 identified solidarity as one of the fundamental and universal values that should underlie relations between peoples in the Twenty-first century, and in that regard decided to proclaim 20 December of each year International Human Solidarity Day. 
At the World Summit for Social Development, Governments committed themselves to the eradication of poverty as an ethical, social, political and economic imperative of humankind. 
By resolution 57/265 the General Assembly, on 20 December 2002, established the World Solidarity Fund, which was set up in February 2003 as a trust fund of the United Nations Development Programme. 
Its objective is to eradicate poverty and promote human and social development in developing countries, in particular among the poorest segments of their populations. 
Through initiatives such as the establishment of the World Solidarity Fund to eradicate poverty and the proclamation of International Human Solidarity Day, the concept of solidarity was promoted as crucial in the fight against poverty and in the involvement of all relevant stakeholders. 
International Human Solidarity Day serves to remind us about the importance of solidarity for the achievement of the international agreements on social development, including programmes of action of international conferences and multilateral accords.

"When their rights are violated, when they are marginalized and excluded, migrants will be unable to contribute either economically or socially to the societies they have left behind or those they enter. 
However, when supported by the right policies and human rights protections, migration can be a force for good for individuals as well as for countries of origin, transit and destination. " 
Message for International Migrants Day 18 December 2011

More than three quarters of a million people became refugees, following upheaval and conflict in Africa and the Middle East. 
UN Photo/OCHA/David Ohana On 4 December 2000, the UN General Assembly, taking into account the large and increasing number of migrants in the world, proclaimed 18 December as International Migrants Day. 
On 18 December 1990, the General Assembly had adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
UN Member States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations are invited to observe International Migrants Day through the dissemination of information on the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and through the sharing of experiences and the design of actions to ensure their protection. 
The 132 Member States that participated in the General Assembly's High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development on 14-15 September 2006 reaffirmed a number of key messages. 
First, they underscored that international migration was a growing phenomenon and that it could make a positive contribution to development in countries of origin and countries of destination provided it was supported by the right policies. 
Secondly, they emphasized that respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of all migrants was essential to reap the benefits of international migration. 
Thirdly, they recognized the importance of strengthening international cooperation on international migration bilaterally, regionally and globally.

This year on 18 July - Nelson Mandela's 93rd birthday - the UN joined a call by the Nelson Mandela Foundation to devote 67 minutes of time to helping others, as a way to mark Nelson Mandela International Day. 
For 67 years Nelson Mandela devoted his life to the service of humanity – as a human rights lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, an international peacemaker and the first democratically elected president of a free South Africa. 
How the Day came about 
In November 2009, the UN General Assembly declared 18 July "Nelson Mandela International Day" in recognition of the former South African President's contribution to the culture of peace and freedom. 
General Assembly resolution A/RES/64/13 recognizes Nelson Mandela's values and his dedication to the service of humanity, in the fields of conflict resolution, race relations, the promotion and protection of human rights, reconciliation, gender equality and the rights of children and other vulnerable groups, as well as the upliftment of poor and underdeveloped communities. 
It acknowledges his contribution to the struggle for democracy internationally and the promotion of a culture of peace throughout the world. 
The Peacebuilding commission (PBC) 
The Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) is an intergovernmental advisory body that supports peace efforts in countries emerging from conflict, and is a key addition to the capacity of the International Community in the broad peace agenda. 
The Peacebuilding Commission plays a unique role in (1) bringing together all of the relevant actors, including international donors, the international financial institutions, national governments, troop contributing countries; 
(2) marshalling resources and (3) advising on and proposing integrated strategies for post-conflict peacebuilding and recovery and where appropriate, highlighting any gaps that threaten to undermine peace.

Mother Earth is a common expression for the planet Earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet. 
For instance, Bolivians call Mother Earth Pachamama and Nicaraguans refer to her as Tonantzin. 
The proclamation of 22 April as International Mother Earth Day is an acknowledgement that the Earth and its ecosystems provide its inhabitants with life and sustenance. It also recognizes a collective responsibility, as called for in the 1992 Rio Declaration, to promote harmony with nature and the Earth to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of present and future generations of humanity. 
This year in June, world leaders will gather at the Rio+20 sustainable development conference, to discus on two main themes: 
how to build a green economy to achieve sustainable development and lift people out of poverty; 
and how to improve international coordination for sustainable development.

International week of solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing territories May 25-31 
International Week of Solidarity with 
Non-Self-Governing Territories 
The UN General Assembly, by its resolution 60/119 of 8 December 2005, requested the annual observance of the Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories. 
In the UN Charter, a Non-Self-Governing Territory is defined as a Territory "whose people have not yet attained a full measure of self-government". In 1946, several UN Member States identified a number of Territories under their administration that were not self-governing and placed them on a UN list. 
Countries administering Non-Self-Governing Territories are called administering Powers. 
As a result of the decolonization process over the years, most of the Territories were removed from the list. 
It urged the administering Powers concerned to take effective measures to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable rights of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to their natural resources, including land, and to establish and maintain control over the future development of those resources, and requests the Administering Powers to take all necessary steps to protect the property rights of the peoples of those Territories. 
It also urged all States, directly and through their action in the specialized 
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, to provide moral and 
material assistance to the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories.

Secretary-General's Message for the Day of Remembrance for all Victims of Chemical Warfare, 29 April 2012 
Secretary-General's Message for 2012 
The Day of Remembrance for All Victims of Chemical Warfare is an occasion to mourn those who have suffered from these inhumane arms and to renew our resolve to eradicate them from our world. 
When we remind the world of the agony inflicted by chemical weapons, we present the most compelling case for permanently outlawing them and establishing and verifying, through the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), a comprehensive and legally binding ban. 
This year marks the 15th anniversary of the entry into force of the CWC. 
Today, with 188 State Parties representing 98 per cent of the world's population, the Convention is standing strong. 
I call on the eight States remaining outside the Convention to join at the earliest possible date. 
There is no excuse for delays in ridding our planet of these instruments of suffering and death. 
Through strong provisions, the Convention provides an effective international regime to verify the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles and to prevent their re-emergence. 
This will reduce the threat of chemical weapons terrorism and strengthen the work of the United Nations to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorists. 
The extended deadline for States parties to complete the destruction of chemical weapons is 29 April. 
Almost three quarters of all declared stockpiles have been destroyed. 
I welcome efforts by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ensure that all chemical weapons are destroyed as soon as possible. 
The OPCW is also continuously monitoring the chemical industry in an effort to prevent the re-emergence of chemical weapons. 
So far, the Organisation has conducted 2200 inspections in 82 countries. 
As we welcome the Convention's achievements, we never let the memory of the victims fade. 
This Day is a time to remember them in the most meaningful way possible: by pledging to ensure that future generations never endure the scourge that these human beings suffered.

International Day for Biological Diversity, 22 May 2012 
Biodiversity, Sustaining Life on Earth Biodiversity, What Is It? Biological diversity — or biodiversity — is the term given to the variety of life on Earth and the natural patterns it forms. 
The biodiversity we see today is the fruit of billions of years of evolution, shaped by natural processes and, increasingly, by the influence of humans. It forms the web of life of which we are an integral part and upon which we so fully depend. This diversity is often understood in terms of the wide variety of plants, animals and microorganisms. 
Scientists reckon that there are actually about 13 million species, though estimates range from three to 100 million. Biodiversity also includes genetic differences within each species — for example, between varieties of crops and breeds of livestock. 
Chromosomes, genes, and DNA-the building blocks of life-determine the uniqueness of each individual and each species. Yet another aspect of biodiversity is the variety of ecosystems such as those that occur in deserts, forests, wetlands, mountains, lakes, rivers, and agricultural landscapes. In each ecosystem, living creatures, including humans, form a community, interacting with one another and with the air, water, and soil around them. It is the combination of life forms and their interactions with each other and with the rest of the environment that has made Earth a uniquely habitable place for humans. 
Biodiversity provides a large number of goods and services that sustain our lives. 
Protecting biodiversity is in our self-interest. 
Biological resources are the pillars upon which we build civilizations. 
Nature's products support such diverse industries as agriculture, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, horticulture, construction and waste treatment. 
The loss of biodiversity threatens our food supplies, opportunities for recreation and tourism, and sources of wood, medicines and energy. 
It also interferes with essential ecological functions. Facts & Figures 
70% of the world's poor live in rural areas and depend directly on biodiversity for their survival and wellbeing. The average abundance of species is declining — 40% loss between 1970 and 2000. 
Unsustainable consumption continues as demand for resources worldwide exceeds the biological capacity of the Earth by about 20%. Our need for pieces of nature we once ignored is often important and unpredictable. Time after time we have rushed back to nature's cupboard for cures to illnesses or for infusions of tough genes from wild plants to save our crops from pest outbreaks. What's more, the vast array of interactions among the various components of biodiversity makes the planet habitable for all species, including humans. 
Our personal health, and the health of our economy and human society, depends on the continuous supply of various ecological services that would be extremely costly or impossible to replace. 
Despite mounting efforts over the past 20 years, the loss of the world's biological diversity, mainly from habitat destruction, over-harvesting, pollution and the inappropriate introduction of foreign plants and animals, has continued. 
International Day for Biological Diversity, 22 May 2012 
Facts & Figures 
Fisheries provide over 15% of dietary intake of animal protein 40% of world's population lives within 100 kilometers of the coast 
Coastal ecosystems provide services and protection from stores that are valued at nearly US$26 billion annually 
One third of the world's fish stocks are over-exploited 
30- 35% of the global extent of critical marine environments are estimated to have been destroyed. 
The oceans cover 70% of the planet's surface area, and marine and coastal environments contain diverse habitats that support an abundance of marine life. 
Life in our seas produces a third of the oxygen that we breathe, offers a valuable source of protein and moderates global climatic change. Some examples of marine and coastal habitats include mangrove forests; coral reefs; sea grass beds; 
The survival of marine and coastal ecosystems and biodiversity is essential to the nutritional, spiritual, societal and religious well-being of many coastal communities. 
But even for the many millions of people who may not think that they have any strong reliance on the ocean, marine ecosystems and wildlife provide all kinds of benefits. Without life in the ocean, there would be no life on Earth. The ocean world is in all our daily lives: Sponges from the Mediterranean have been used for painting, cooking, cleaning and even contraception for at least 5,000 years. 
Substances derived from seaweeds stabilize and thicken creams, sauces, and pastes, are mixed into paint and used to make paper and even in skin lotion and toothpaste. Many marine plants and animals also contain a multitude of substances already being used, or identified as being of potential use, in medicines. Most importantly of all, tiny marine plants called phytoplankton produce energy, like plants on land, through photosynthesis. 
How Much Life Is in the Sea? From 2000 to 2010, an unprecedented worldwide collaboration by scientists around the world set out to try and determine how much life is in the sea. 
Dubbed the 'Census of Marine Life', the effort involved 2,700 scientists from over 80 nations, who participated in 540 expeditions around the world. 
They studied surface seawater and probed the deepest, darkest depths of the ocean, sailed tropical seas and explored ice-strewn oceans in the Arctic and Antarctic. 
By the time the Census ended, it had added 1,200 species to the known roster of life in the sea; scientists are still working their way through another 5,000 specimens to determine whether they are also newly-discovered species. The estimate of the number of known marine species — the species that have been identified and the ones that have been documented but await classification — has increased as a direct result of the Census efforts, and is now around 250,000. (This total does not include some microbial life forms such as marine viruses.)

International Day of Cooperatives - 3 July 2010 
Theme for 2011 
This year's theme highlights how the cooperative model of enterprise can successfully empower youth. 
It links to the celebration of the United Nations International Year of Youth, which encourages dialogue and understanding across generations and promotes the ideals of peace, respect for human rights and freedoms, and solidarity. 
The International Day of Cooperatives addresses the need for all cooperative stakeholders to promote the participation of young people in the cooperative movement. 
Too often young people are not aware of the cooperative model of enterprise - they do not learn about cooperatives in school as cooperatives often do not figure in school curricula. 
Young people also may not do not realize that the products and services that they use are provided by cooperatives. 
Yet, cooperatives provide young people opportunities that address their practical and strategic needs. 
They offer them a model of enterprise to create their own businesses. 
They offer the opportunities to be employed with enterprises that address young people's concerns for more democratic, responsible and ethical business operations. 
Cooperatives provide opportunities to young people to gain professional employment experience, to further their education and provide capacity building, encourage participation in decision-making in cooperatives or form their own cooperatives. 
The significance of cooperatives have been acknowledged as associations and enterprises through which citizens can effectively improve their lives while contributing to the economic, social, cultural and political advancement of their community and nation. 
The cooperative movement has been also recognized as a distinct and major stakeholder in both national and international affairs. 
The cooperative movement is highly democratic, locally autonomous but internationally integrated, and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives, such as overcoming poverty, securing productive employment and encouraging social integration. 
In 1992, following a concerted lobbying effort by the cooperative movements in membership of the International Co- operative Alliance (ICA) and members of the Committee for the Promotion and Advancement of Cooperatives (COPAC), the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the International Day of Cooperatives by the UN by resolution 47/90 of 16 December 1992. 
The resolution states: 
"... 
The General Assembly, ... 
Proclaims the first Saturday of July 1995 to be the International Day of Cooperatives, marking the centenary of the establishment of the International Co-operative Alliance, and decides to consider the possibility of observing an International Day of Cooperatives in future years; ..." 
The date of the celebration of the International Day was chosen to coincide with the already existing International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) International Cooperative Day with has been celebrated since 1923. 
In 1994, the United Nations General Assembly adopted another resolution 49/155 of 23 December 1994 on cooperatives which not only called on governments and international agencies to: 
"consider fully the potential of cooperatives for contributing to the solution of economic, social and environmental problems in formulating national development strategies; 
and consider reviewing legal and administrative constraints on the activities of cooperatives with a view to eliminating those constraints that are not applied to other businesses and enterprises", 
but also invited: 
governments, relevant international organizations, specialized agencies and national and international cooperative organizations to observe annually the International Day of Cooperatives on the first Saturday of July starting from 1995, as proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 47/90". 
Since that date the global community celebrates United Nations International Day of Cooperatives and ICA's International Cooperative Day on the first Saturday of July. 
The United Nations Secretary-General issues a message on the occasion of the day as does the International Co-operative Alliance as well as other COPAC members. 
Celebrations of the Day are held at the international, national and local levels around the world.

Secretary-General's Messages - International Day of Cooperatives - 3 July 2010 
The theme for this year's International Day of Cooperatives, "Youth, the Future of Cooperatives", highlights the enormous value of engaging the energy and drive of young people. 
In the wake of the global financial and economic crisis, youth unemployment is at an all-time high. 
Expanding opportunity through youth entrepreneurship is one way to address this challenge. 
The cooperative model enables young people to create and manage sustainable enterprises. 
Cooperatives are underpinned by the pooling of financial and human resources, technical knowledge and business skills. 
Furthermore, their member-driven structure roots them in communities, encouraging socially responsible businesses that meet local needs. 
Through their distinctive focus on values, cooperatives have proven themselves a resilient and viable business model that can prosper even during difficult times. 
This success has helped prevent many families and communities from sliding into poverty. 
Cooperatives have also continuously provided reliable access to credit and other financial services for many small business holders. 
Moreover, cooperatives have done so while promoting self-reliance and creating stability in the markets in which they operate. 
Throughout this year's observance of the International Year of Youth, decision makers around the world have stressed the importance of including young people at all levels of the development process. 
The active inclusion of young women and men in social and economic development helps reduce social exclusion, improve productive capacity, break cycles of poverty, promote gender equality and raise environmental responsibility. 
As we move into the International Year of Cooperatives, which will be officially launched this October, I invite young people to explore the benefits of pursuing cooperative enterprise and other forms of social entrepreneurship. 
Let us recognize young women and men as valuable partners in strengthening the cooperative movement and in sustaining the role of cooperatives in social and economic development. 
United Nations observances contribute to the achievement of the purposes of the UN Charter and promote awareness of and action on important political, social, cultural, humanitarian or human rights issues. They provide a useful means for the promotion of international and national action and stimulate interest in United Nations activities and programmes.

Past Themes Documents 
Family issues became an object of increasing attention at the United Nations during the 1980s. 
In 1983, acting on the recommendation of the Commission for Social Development at its twenty-eighth session, the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution on the role of the family in the development process(1983/23), requested that the Secretary-General "enhance awareness among decision makers and public of the problems and needs of the family, as well as effective ways of meeting those needs." 
In its resolution 1985/29 of 29 May 1985, the Council invited the General Assembly to consider the possibility of including "an item entitled 'Families in the development process', with a view to considering a possible request to the Secretary-General to initiate a process of development of global awareness of the issues involved." 
Subsequently, acting on the recommendation of the Commission for Social Development at its thirtieth session and the Council at its first regular session of 1987 (resolution 1987/42 of 28 May 1987), the Assembly, in its resolution 42/134 of 7 December 1987, invited "all States to make their views known concerning the possible proclamation of an international year of the family and to offer their comments and proposals." 
It also requested "the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its forty-third session a comprehensive report, based on the comments and proposals of Member States, on the possible proclamation of such a year and other ways and means to improve the position and well-being of the family and to intensify international co-operation as part of global efforts to advance social progress and development". 
1994 was proclaimed the International Year of the Family by the United Nations General Assembly, in its resolution 44/82 of 9 December 1989.

United Nations observances contribute to the achievement of the purposes of the UN Charter and promote awareness of and action on important political, social, cultural, humanitarian or human rights issues. 
They provide a useful means for the promotion of international and national action and stimulate interest in United Nations activities and programmes. 
For international years and decades the UN Secretary General takes action to establish the preparatory process, evaluation and follow-up procedures. 
The majority of observances have been established by the UN General Assembly and some have been designated by UN specialized agencies. 
In 1950, the General Assembly approved the first international day — Human Rights Day — to be observed on 10 December. 
Resolution 423 (V) invited all states and international organizations to observe this day to celebrate the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly on 10 December 1948, and to exert increasing efforts in this field. 
In 1978, the General Assembly by its resolution S-10/2 proclaimed the first international week — the week starting 24 October (the day of the founding of the UN) — as a week devoted to fostering the objectives of disarmament (Disarmament Week). 
The first international year was proclaimed by the General Assembly in 1959. It was the World Refugee Year [Resolution 1285 (XIII)]. 
The first UN decade was the United Nations Development Decade designated by the General Assembly in 1961 [Resolution 1710 (XVI)]. 
Secretary-General's Message on the International Day of Families 
Secretary-General's Message for 2012 
This year's International Day of Families highlights the need for work-family balance. The aim is to help workers everywhere provide for their families financially and emotionally, while also contributing to the socio-economic development of their societies. 
Current trends underscore the growing importance of work-family policies. These include greater participation by women in the labour market, and growing urbanization and mobility in search for jobs. 
As families become smaller and generations live apart, extended kin are less available to offer care, and employed parents face rising challenges. 
Millions of people around the world lack decent working conditions and the social support to care for their families. 
Affordable quality childcare is rarely available in developing countries, where many parents are forced to leave their preschool children home alone. 
Many young children are also left in the care of older siblings who, in turn, are pulled from school. 
A number of countries offer generous leave provisions for mothers and fathers. 
Many more, however, extend few comprehensive benefits in line with international standards. 
Paternity leave provisions are still rare in the majority of developing countries. 
Flexible working arrangements, including staggered working hours, compressed work schedules or telecommuting, are becoming more widely available – but there is much room for improvement everywhere. 
I am committed to this in our own organization, where we are currently looking at our own arrangements, and seeing what we can do better. 
We need to respond to the ever-changing complexities of work and family life. 
I welcome the establishment of family-friendly workplaces through parental leave provisions, flexible working arrangements and better childcare. 
Such policies and programmes are critical to enhancing the work-family balance. 
These actions can also lead to better working conditions, greater employee health and productivity, and a more concerted focus on gender equality. 
Work-family balance policies demonstrate both a government's commitment to the well-being of families and the private sector's commitment to social responsibility. 
On this International Day of Families, let us renew our pledge to promote work-family balance for the benefit of families and society at large.

Message of the United Nations Secretary-General for the International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, 25 March 
UN Observances Message of the United Nations Secretary-General 
The transatlantic slave trade was a tragedy because of slavery's fundamental barbarism and immense scope, and because of its organized, systematic nature. 
One set of human beings — the traders, owners and others who participated in and profited from this evil enterprise " elevated themselves above another, assaulting their victims' very essence. 
"I can remember", said one former slave in recorded testimony now posted on the UN website, when "they carried my father away and carried two sisters and one brother, and left me. 
This International Day was established for this woman — and for the many millions of people whose lives and families were destroyed, and whose dignity was so brutally negated. 
As a reminder for future generations of the inhumane suffering endured by the victims over a 400-year period, and as a tribute to the spirited resistance to the system, a permanent memorial is to be erected at UN Headquarters. 
I am proud that the United Nations will host a memorial symbolizing universal recognition of a tragedy that befell Africans and people of African descent and disgraced humankind as a whole. 
In addition to remembering the crimes of the slave trade, we also use this Day to teach about the causes and consequences of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
And we pledge to be ever vigilant about the many contemporary forms of slavery, including debt bondage, trafficking in persons, sexual exploitation, the worst forms of child labour, forced marriage and the forced recruitment of children for use in armed conflict. 
New laws, institutions and mindsets have given us better tools for the struggle against these ills. 
Yet we must also recognize that bias has increased in many parts of the world. 
We see discriminatory practices gaining political, moral and even legal recognition, including through the platforms of some political parties and organizations and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on the notion of racial superiority. 
The United Nations remains firmly committed to countering such hateful acts and trends. 
This is a matter of principle, in keeping with our Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Political Declaration adopted at last year's High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. 
But it is also a means to an end: intolerance and discrimination are among the roots of conflicts and are major obstacles to development. 
The theme of this year's observance, "Honouring the heroes, resisters and survivors", recognizes those who stood up against slavery when the trade was at its height, and those who stand up now to protect against its manifestations today. 
On this International Day, let us all reaffirm our commitment to combating racism and building societies based on justice, equality and solidarity. 
Background on the International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, 25 March 
Slave Ship Sighting an English Cruiser – 1874 Harpers Weekly "This sketch represents a slave ship in the Mediterranean, near the coast of Africa, where a large cargo of slaves has 
sail and try to make their escape. " Transatlantic slave trade The transatlantic slave trade was the largest forced migration in history, and incontrovertibly one of the most inhumane. 
The extensive exodus of Africans spread to many areas of the world over a 400-year period and was unprecedented in the annals of recorded human history. As a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade, the greatest movement of Africans was to the Americas — with 96 per cent of the captives from the African coasts arriving on cramped slave ships at ports in South America and the Caribbean Islands. From 1501 to 1830, four Africans crossed the Atlantic for every one European, making the demographics of the Americas in that era more of an extension of the African diaspora than a European one. 
The legacy of this migration is still evident today, with large populations of people of African descent living throughout the Americas. Heroism, resistance and survival A spirited resistance by the millions of enslaved peoples began from the onset of that brutal system. 
Some tried running away, sabotage and other nonviolent actions; others resorted to poisoning, murder and uprisings. Those that inspired the most fear were armed revolts. In the Middle Passage too they mounted fierce rebellions, perhaps the most notable of which was the revolt onboard the slave ship Amistad in 1839, which later became a symbol in efforts to abolish slavery. 
In the various overseas destinations where they faced life as slaves, enslaved peoples continued to fight for their freedom. 
Every country in the Americas had an African presence, and in every country, plots were hatched and actual uprisings took place. This year's commemoration honours the heroes, resisters and survivors — those who, like Zumbi dos Palmares, Harriet Tubman and the anonymous slave portrayed in the poster, made noble and valiant sacrifices to bring the transatlantic slave trade to an end.

Background - International Day in Support of Victims of Torture - 26 June 
"[T]he term 'torture' means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. 
It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions." 
Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
In 1948, the international community condemned torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. 
In 1975, responding to vigorous activity by non-governmental organizations(NGOs), the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
During the 1980s and 1990s, progress was made both in the development of legal standards and instruments and in enforcement of the prohibition of torture. 
The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture was established by the General Assembly in 1981 to fund organizations providing assistance to victims of torture and their families. 
The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was adopted by the General Assembly in 1984 and came into force in 1987. 
Its implementation by States parties is monitored by a body of independent experts, the Committee against Torture. 
The first Special Rapporteur on torture, an independent expert mandated to report on the situation of torture in the world, was appointed by the Commission on Human Rights in 1985. 
During the same period, the General Assembly adopted resolutions in which it highlighted the role of health personnel in protecting prisoners and detainees against torture and established general principles for the treatment of detained persons. 
In December 1997, the General Assembly proclaimed 26 June United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. 
The United Nations has repeatedly acknowledged the important role played by NGOs in the fight against torture. 
In addition to lobbying for the establishment of United Nations instruments and monitoring mechanisms, they have made a valuable contribution to their enforcement. 
Individual experts, including the Special Rapporteur on torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, and treaty monitoring bodies such as the Committee against Torture rely heavily on information brought to their attention by NGOs and individuals. 
Secretary-General's Messages - International Day in Support of Victims of Torture - 26 June 
Secretary-General's Message for 2011 
Torture is a brutal attempt to destroy a person's sense of dignity and sense of human worth. 
It acts also as a weapon of war, spreading terror beyond its direct victims to communities and societies. 
On the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, we honour the men and women who have suffered, enduring their ordeal with courage and inner strength. 
We mourn, too, those who did not survive. 
States must take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under their jurisdiction. 
There are no exceptional circumstances whatsoever – whether a state of war, or a threat of war, internal political instability, or any other public emergency or national security situation. 
States' obligations also include the duty to provide effective and prompt redress, compensation and rehabilitation for all torture victims. 
Returning to ordinary life after torture is hard. 
The United Nations Trust Fund for Victims of Torture assists individuals and organizations around the world to ease physical and psychological pain, re-start shattered lives and support the right to truth and justice through legal assistance. 
I thank those Governments and other contributors who make this assistance possible, and I call on all members of the international community to support the Fund. 
I also commend the many individuals and organizations that provide medical, psychological, legal and social assistance to victims of torture and their families. 
The recent entry into force of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance is a welcome addition to the body of international human rights law, since enforced disappearance is yet another manifestation of torture. 
I appeal to all Members States to allow full and unhindered access by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture to places where people are deprived of liberty in their country. 
I also call on all States that have not done so to ratify the Convention against Torture, and to allow individual complaints by victims under its instruments. 
At a time when the legitimate aspirations of people in many regions of the world for greater freedom, dignity and a better life are too often met with violence and repression, I urge States to respect the fundamental rights of all people. 
Torture and other forms of cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment and punishment, wherever they occur and whatever the circumstances, can never be justified.

International Human Solidarity Day - Solidarity and the UN 
UN Observances Follow Us: Solidarity and the United Nations 
Convinced that the promotion of the culture of solidarity and the spirit of sharing was important for combating poverty, the General Assembly proclaimed 20 December as International Human Solidarity Day. 
Therefore, International Human Solidarity Day is: 
A day to celebrate our unity in diversity; 
A day to remind governments to respect their commitments to international agreements; 
A day to raise public awareness of the importance of solidarity; 
A day to encourage debate on the ways to promote solidarity for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals including poverty eradication; 
A day of action to encourage new initiatives for poverty eradication. 
The UN and the Concept of Solidarity 
The concept of solidarity has defined the work of the United Nations since the birth of the Organization. 
The creation of the United Nations drew the peoples and nations of the world together to promote peace, human rights and social and economic development. 
The organization was founded on a basic premise of unity and harmony among its members expressed in the concept of collective security that relies on the solidarity of its members to unite "to maintain international peace and security". 
It is in the spirit of solidarity that the organization relies on "cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character" as well. 
International Human Solidarity Day - Secretary-General's Message 
Secretary-General's Message for 2011 
This year's observance of International Human Solidarity Day comes at a time when our world is confronting multiple challenges and opportunities. 
The old world is gradually but unmistakably changing, and the contours of a new one are just beginning to take shape. 
This year, the world population reached 7 billion people. 
New austerity is taking hold. 
New anxieties are giving rise to tensions and fears. 
At the same time, we have before us a world of possibilities – in fighting disease, in harnessing technology, in bridging socioeconomic gaps and inequalities. 
Nor will it happen with business as usual. 
Our times demand something different. 
We need big thinking, bold action and efforts to connect the dots among global challenges. 
At the General Assembly last September, I called upon world leaders to pay greater attention to five imperatives for the 21st century for which solidarity is essential: achieving sustainable development; 
preventing and mitigating conflicts, human rights abuses and the impacts of natural disasters; 
building a safer and more secure world; 
supporting countries in transition; 
and engaging the talents of women and young people. 
Next year's United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) will be an opportunity to take action and revitalize a global partnership – with the full range of governmental, civil society and private sector leaders – for inclusive and sustainable development for all. 
In a world of common challenges, no nation can succeed on its own; 
Solidarity must be the foundation for global solutions.

International International Migrants Day - 11 December - Background 
Throughout human history, migration has been a courageous expression of the individual's will to overcome adversity and to live a better life. 
Today, globalization, together with advances in communications and transportation, has greatly increased the number of people who have the desire and the capacity to move to other places. 
This new era has created challenges and opportunities for societies throughout the world. 
It also has served to underscore the clear linkage between migration and development, as well as the opportunities it provides for co-development, that is, the concerted improvement of economic and social conditions at both origin and destination. 
International migration today 
The total number of international migrants has increased over the last 10 years from an estimated 150 million in 2000 to 214 million persons today. 
Migrants would constitute the fifth most populous country in the world. 
Migration is now more widely distributed across more countries. 
Today the top 10 countries of destination receive a smaller share of all migrants than in 2000. 49% of migrants worldwide are women. Remittances have increased exponentially: 
up from USD 132 billion in 2000 to an estimated USD 440 billion in 2010, even with a slight decline due to the current economic crisis. 
Migration and development 
The lure of a well-paid job in a wealthy country is a powerful driver of international migration. 
The attraction has intensified as income differentials among countries continue to grow. 
This holds true not only regarding the large and growing differentials between high and low-income countries, but also with regard to the more dynamic and the less dynamic developing countries. 
Many advanced and dynamic economies need migrant workers to fill jobs that cannot be outsourced and that do not find local workers willing to take them at going wages. 
Population ageing also underlies this growing demand, as it gives rise to deficits of workers relative to dependants. 
And as younger generations become better educated, fewer in their ranks are content with low-paid and physically demanding jobs. 
Migration may reduce wages or lead to higher unemployment among low-skilled workers in advanced economies, many of whom are themselves migrants who arrived in earlier waves. 
However, most migrants complement the skills of domestic workers instead of competing with them. 
By performing tasks that either would go undone or cost more, migrants allow citizens to perform other, more productive and better-paid jobs. 
They also maintain viable economic activities that, in their absence, would be outsourced. 
By enlarging the labour force and the pool of consumers and by contributing their entrepreneurial capacities, migrants boost economic growth in receiving countries. 
At the point of origin, deeper poverty does not lead automatically to higher migration. 
The poorest people generally do not have the resources to bear the costs and risks of international migration. 
International migrants are usually drawn from middle-income households. 
However, when migrants establish themselves abroad, they help friends and relatives to follow and, in the process, the costs and risks of migration fall, making it possible for poorer people, though not for the poorest, to join the stream. 
Low-skilled migration has the largest potential to reduce the depth and severity of poverty in communities of origin. 
Mounting evidence indicates that international migration is usually positive both for countries of origin and of destination. 
Its potential benefits are larger than the potential gains from freer international trade, particularly for developing countries. 
The United Nations and Migrants 
On 4 December 2000, the General Assembly, taking into account the large and increasing number of migrants in the world, proclaimed 18 December International Migrants Day (A/RES/55/93). 
On that day, in 1990, the Assembly adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (A/RES/45/158). 
Member States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations are invited to observe International Migrants Day through the dissemination of information on the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and through the sharing of experiences and the design of actions to ensure their protection. 
The 132 Member States that participated in the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, conducted by the General Assembly on 14 and 15 September 2006, reaffirmed a number of key messages. 
Although the High-level Dialogue stressed that international migration could contribute to development, it recognized that international migration was not a substitute for development. 
All too often, migrants were compelled to seek employment abroad because of poverty, conflict or violations of human rights. 
Peace and security, good governance, the rule of law and the provision of decent work in countries of origin ensured that people migrated out of choice instead of necessity. 
International migration needed to be an integral part of the development agenda and should be part of national development strategies. 
Following the High-level Dialogue, the Government of Belgium launched a process to establish the Global Forum on Migration and Development as a voluntary, non-binding and informal consultative process, led by and open to all States Members of the United Nations and observers. 
By providing a venue for Governments to address issues related to international migration and development in a systematic and comprehensive way, the Global Forum brings together Government expertise from all regions, promotes dialogue, cooperation and partnerships, and fosters practical and action-oriented outcomes at the national, regional and global levels. 
Since the 2006 High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, intergovernmental cooperation in the area of migration has increased markedly. 
Various regional intergovernmental groups and consultative processes have been focusing increasingly on the development dimensions of international migration, although they have done so in different ways and with different perspectives. 
The need to understand better the issues raised by international migration in relation to development, to exchange experience and know-how, and to build common positions has propelled more countries to join regional groups and some regional groups to cooperate with each other. 
It seems that the High-level Dialogue served as a catalyst to generate considerable activity in this area. 
International Migrants Day - 18 December - Secretary-General's Messages 
Secretary-General's Message for 2011 
Migration affects all countries – and so do myths and misperceptions about its impact. 
There are many false assumptions surrounding migration. 
One such myth is that migrants are a burden. 
In reality, migrants make vast contributions to host countries. 
As workers, they bring skills. 
As entrepreneurs, they create jobs. 
As investors, they bring capital. 
In advanced and emerging economies, they play an indispensible role in agriculture, tourism and domestic work. 
Migrants often care for the youngest and oldest members of society. 
People view irregular migration as a crime. 
Many think migrants who lack proper documents are a danger to society and should be detained, or that all women who migrate to take up low-skilled jobs have been trafficked. 
These and other unfounded beliefs lead to the adoption of migration policies that are irrelevant at best or even dangerous. 
States have the sovereign prerogative to manage their borders. 
But they also have the duty to abide by their international legal obligations. 
Under international human rights law, all persons, without discrimination and regardless of nationality or legal status, are entitled to enjoy fundamental human rights. 
No migrant should be sent back to a place where he or she will be tortured. 
Every migrant woman should have access to health care, including reproductive health care. 
Every migrant child should be able to go to school. 
Human rights are not a matter of charity, nor are they a reward for obeying immigration rules. 
Human rights are the inalienable entitlement of every person, including the world's 214 million international migrants as well as their family members. 
Forty-five countries have ratified the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. 
I call on all others to join this important treaty as a concrete affirmation of their commitment to protect and promote the human rights of all migrants on their territories. 
When their rights are violated, when they are marginalized and excluded, migrants will be unable to contribute either economically or socially to the societies they have left behind or those they enter. 
However, when supported by the right policies and human rights protections, migration can be a force for good for individuals as well as for countries of origin, transit and destination. 
Let us give meaning to International Migrants Day by taking constructive steps to leverage this global phenomenon into a force for progress.

Secretary-General's Message for 2011 
Beginning with the words "We the peoples", the United Nations Charter reminds us that crafting solutions to global challenges is a job not only for Governments, but for people, communities and civil society. 
On International Volunteer Day, we recognize the dedication of volunteers, their admirable spirit of service, and their wide-ranging efforts to promote the goals of the United Nations. 
Volunteering matters. 
All over the globe, millions of volunteers are helping to advance sustainable development and peace. 
This engagement takes many forms: volunteering organizations, individuals working on their own in their communities, and service with us and our partners as UN Volunteers. 
This year's first-ever State of the World's Volunteerism Report showcases the impact that volunteers have made. 
I congratulate the UN Volunteers programme and commend the many millions of volunteers working for sustainable development, humanitarian assistance, environmental preservation, and progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. 
With passion and commitment, they are helping to show how volunteering can change the world. 
As we mark International Volunteer Day, I encourage policymakers to do even more to support and welcome volunteerism, and I urge everyone to consider what they can do to join the movement.

Nelson Mandela's achievements came at great personal cost to himself and his family. 
His sacrifice not only served the people of his own nation, South Africa, but made the world a better place for all people, everywhere… He showed the way. 
He changed the world. 
Can you spare 67 minutes of your time helping others? 
On this year's Mandela Day, people around the world were asked by the Nelson Mandela Foundation to do just that. 
By devoting 67 minutes of their time – one minute for every year of Mr. Mandela's public service – people made a small gesture of solidarity with humanity and a step towards a global movement for good. 
In New York, visitors to the Nelson Mandela International Day interactive exhibit at UN Headquarters were invited to make their own pledge to devote 67 minutes of their time to public service. 
If you would like to donate your own time to public service, here are some things you can do to take action and inspire change, as others did on Mandela Day 2011: 
Make a new friend. 
Get to know someone from a different cultural background. 
Only through mutual understanding can we rid our communities of intolerance and xenophobia. 
Read to someone who can't. 
Visit a local home for the blind and open up a new world for someone else. 
Help out at the local animal shelter. 
Dogs without homes still need a walk and a bit of love. 
Help someone get a job. 
Put together and print a CV for them, or help them with their interview skills. 
Many terminally ill people have no one to speak to. 
Take a little time to have a chat and bring some sunshine into their lives. 
Get tested for HIV and encourage your partner to do so too. 
Take someone you know, who can't afford it, to get their eyes tested or their teeth checked. 
Donate a wheelchair or guide dog, to someone in need. 
Buy a few blankets, or grab the ones you no longer need from home and give them to someone in need. 
To see all 67 suggestions for action, visit the Nelson Mandela Foundation site.

Key statements and speeches by Nelson Mandela, 1961 - 2008 
On freedom 
On racial discrimination 
On human rights 
On building peace 
On fighting poverty 
Those who are voteless cannot be expected to continue paying taxes to a government which is not responsible to them. 
People who live in poverty and starvation cannot be expected to pay exorbitant house rents to the government and local authorities. 
We furnish the sinews of agriculture and industry. 
We produce the work of the gold mines, the diamonds and the coal, of the farms and industry, in return for miserable wages. 
Why should we continue enriching those who steal the products of our sweat and blood? 
Those who exploit us and refuse us the right to organise trade unions? ... 
I am informed that a warrant for my arrest has been issued, and that the police are looking for me. ... 
Any serious politician will realise that under present-day conditions in this country, to seek for cheap martyrdom by handing myself to the police is naive and criminal. 
We have an important programme before us and it is important to carry it out very seriously and without delay. 
I have chosen this latter course, which is more difficult and which entails more risk and hardship than sitting in gaol. 
I have had to separate myself from my dear wife and children, from my mother and sisters, to live as an outlaw in my own land. 
I have had to close my business, to abandon my profession, and live in poverty and misery, as many of my people are doing. ... 
I shall fight the government side by side with you, inch by inch, and mile by mile, until victory is won. 
What are you going to do? 
Will you come along with us, or are you going to cooperate with the government in its efforts to suppress the claims and aspirations of your own people? 
Or are you going to remain silent and neutral in a matter of life and death to my people, to our people? 
For my own part I have made my choice. 
I will not leave South Africa, nor will I surrender. 
Only through hardship, sacrifice and militant action can freedom be won. 
The struggle is my life. 
I will continue fighting for freedom until the end of my days. 
"The Struggle is my Life" - Press Statement issued while underground in South Africa, 26, June 1961 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
In its proper meaning equality before the law means the right to participate in the making of the laws by which one is governed, a constitution which guarantees democratic rights to all sections of the population, the right to approach the court for protection or relief in the case of the violation of rights guaranteed in the constitution, and the right to take part in the administration of justice as judges, magistrates, attorneys-general, law advisers and similar positions. 
In the absence of these safeguards the phrase "equality before the law", in so far as it is intended to apply to us, is meaningless and misleading. 
All the rights and privileges to which I have referred are monopolized by whites, and we enjoy none of them. … 
(I) consider myself neither morally nor legally obliged to obey laws made by a parliament in which I am not represented. 
That the will of the people is the basis of the authority of government is a principle universally acknowledged as sacred throughout the civilised world, and constitutes the basic foundations of freedom and justice. 
It is understandable why citizens, who have the vote as well as the right to direct representation in the country's governing bodies, should be morally and legally bound by the laws governing the country. 
It should be equally understandable why we, as Africans, should adopt the attitude that we are neither morally nor legally bound to obey laws which we have not made, nor can we be expected to have confidence in courts which enforce such laws. … 
I hate the practice of race discrimination, and in my hatred I am sustained by the fact that the overwhelming majority of mankind hate it equally. 
I hate the systematic inculcation of children with colour prejudice and I am sustained in that hatred by the fact that the overwhelming majority of mankind, here and abroad, are with me in that. 
I hate the racial arrogance which decrees that the good things of life shall be retained as the exclusive right of a minority of the population, and which reduces the majority of the population to a position of subservience and inferiority, and maintains them as voteless chattels to work where they are told and behave as they are told by the ruling minority. 
I am sustained in that hatred by the fact that the overwhelming majority of mankind both in this country and abroad are with me. 
Nothing that this court can do to me will change in any way that hatred in me, which can only be removed by the removal of the injustice and the inhumanity which I have sought to remove from the political and social life of this country. ... 
Court statement, Pretoria, South Africa, 15 October–7 November 1962 
The complaint of Africans ... 
is not only that they are poor and the whites are rich, but that the laws which are made by the whites are designed to preserve this situation. 
There are two ways to break out of poverty. 
The first is by formal education, and the second is by the worker acquiring a greater skill at his work and thus higher wages. 
As far as Africans are concerned, both these avenues of advancement are deliberately curtailed by legislation. ... 
Above all, we want equal political rights, because without them our disabilities will be permanent. 
I know this sounds revolutionary to the whites in this country, because the majority of voters will be Africans. 
This makes the white man fear democracy. 
But this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the only solution which will guarantee racial harmony and freedom for all. 
It is not true that the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. 
Political division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one colour group by another. 
The ANC has spent half a century fighting against racialism. 
When it triumphs it will not change that policy. 
This then is what the ANC is fighting. Their struggle is a truly national one. 
It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by their own suffering and their own experience. 
It is a struggle for the right to live. 
During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. 
I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. 
It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. 
But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. 
Pretoria, South Africa, 20 April 1964 
Our struggle has reached a decisive moment. We call on our people to seize this moment so that the process towards democracy is rapid and uninterrupted. 
We have waited too long for our freedom. 
We can no longer wait. Now is the time to intensify the struggle on all fronts. 
To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive. 
The sight of freedom looming on the horizon should encourage us to redouble our efforts. 
It is only through disciplined mass action that our victory can be assured. 
We call on our white compatriots to join us in the shaping of a new South Africa. 
The freedom movement is a political home for you too. 
We call on the international community to continue the campaign to isolate the apartheid regime. 
To lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process towards the complete eradication of apartheid. 
Our march to freedom is irreversible. We must not allow fear to stand in our way. 
Universal suffrage on a common voters' role in a united democratic and non-racial South Africa is the only way to peace and racial harmony.... 
On release from prison, Cape Town, South Africa, 11 February 1990 
On racial discrimination It will forever remain an indelible blight on human history that the apartheid crime ever occurred. 
What error was made that this system established itself in the wake of the adoption of a universal declaration of human rights? 
It will forever remain an accusation and a challenge to all men and women of conscience that it took as long as it has before all of us stood up to say 'enough is enough.'... 
Let us travel it together. 
Let us, by our joint actions, vindicate the purposes for which this Organization was established and create a situation wherein its Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will become part of the body of law on which will be based the political and social order of a new South Africa. 
Our common victory is assured. 
Address to the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid, 22 June 1990 
It surely must be one of the great ironies of our age that this august Assembly is addressed, for the first time in its 49 years, by a South African Head of State drawn from among the African majority of what is an African country. 
Future generations will find it strange in the extreme that it was only so late in the 20th century that it was possible for our delegation to take its seat in the Assembly, recognized both by our people and the nations of the world as the legitimate representative of the people of our country. 
It is indeed a most welcome thing that this august Organization will mark its 50th anniversary next year with the apartheid system having been vanquished and consigned to the past. 
That historic change has come about not least because of the great efforts in which the UN engaged to ensure the suppression of the apartheid crime against humanity. … 
In all we do, we have to ensure the healing of the wounds inflicted on all our people across the great dividing line imposed on our society by centuries of colonialism and apartheid. 
We must ensure that colour, race and gender become only a God-given gift to each one of us and not an indelible mark or attribute that accords a special status to any. 
We must work for the day when we, as South Africans, see one another and interact with one another as equal human beings and as part of one nation united, rather than torn asunder, by its diversity. 
The road we shall have to travel to reach this destination will by no means be easy. 
All of us know how stubbornly racism can cling to the mind and how deeply it can infect the human soul. 
Where it is sustained by the racial ordering of the material world, as is the case in our country, that stubbornness can multiply a hundred-fold. 
And yet however hard the battle will be, we will not surrender. 
Whatever the time it will take, we will not tire. 
The very fact that racism degrades both the perpetrator and the victim commands that, if we are true to our commitment to protect human dignity, we fight on until victory is achieved. 
Address to the United Nations General Assembly, 3 October 1994 
We in South Africa are convinced that it is both possible and practicable to reach our goal of a better life for all in the shortest possible time. 
We derive our confidence from the knowledge that this is a vision shared by the overwhelming majority of South Africans across the colour and political divides. 
And we fully appreciate the role of the international community in making this happen — not only in the form of material support. 
If we are able today to speak proudly of a rainbow nation, united in its diversity of culture, religion, race, language and ethnicity, it is in part because the world set us a moral example which we dared to follow. 
This achievement is bound to last because it is founded on the realisation that reconciliation and nation-building mean, among other things, that we should set out to know the truth about the terrible past and ensure it does not recur. 
Ours must therefore not be merely a respite before the bitterness of the past once more reasserts itself. 
We recognise too, that reconciliation and nation-building would remain pious words if they were not premised on a concerted effort to remove the real roots of past conflict and injustice. 
Our national security and the survival of our young democracy depend, above everything else, on the programme to meet the basic needs of the people. 
Reconstruction and development will ensure that all South Africans have a stake in life; that they share an interest in the well-being of the country as a whole. 
New Delhi, India, 25 January 1995 
Many people have been sceptical of our capacity to realise the ideal of a rainbow nation. 
It is true that South Africa was often brought to the brink of destruction because of differences. 
But let us re-affirm this one thing here today: it is not our diversity which divides us, it is not our ethnicity, or religion or culture that divides us. 
Since we have achieved our freedom, there can only be one division amongst us: between those who cherish democracy and those who do not! 
As freedom loving people, we want to see our country prosper and provide basic services to all. 
For our freedom can never be complete or our democracy stable unless the basic needs of our people are met. 
We have seen the stability that development brings. And in turn we know that peace is the most powerful weapon that any community or nation can have for development. 
As we rebuild our country, we should remain vigilant against the enemies of development and democracy, even if they come from within our own ranks. 
Violence will not bring us closer to our objectives. 
All of us should ask ourselves the question: Have I done everything in my power to bring about lasting peace and prosperity in my city and my country? ... 
Durban, South Africa, 16 April 1999 
Quite appropriately, this 53rd General Assembly [of the United Nations] will be remembered through the ages as the moment at which we marked and celebrated the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Born in the aftermath of the defeat of the Nazi and fascist crime against humanity, this Declaration held high the hope that all our societies would, in future, be built on the foundations of the glorious vision spelt out in each of its clauses. 
For those who had to fight for their emancipation, such as ourselves who, with your help, had to free ourselves from the criminal apartheid system, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights served as the vindication of the justice of our cause. 
At the same time, it constituted a challenge to us that our freedom, once achieved, should be dedicated to the implementation of the perspectives contained in the Declaration 
Today, we celebrate the fact that this historic document has survived a turbulent five decades, which have seen some of the most extraordinary developments in the evolution of human society. 
These include the collapse of the colonial system, the passing of a bipolar world, breath taking advances in science and technology and the entrenchment of the complex process of globalisation. 
And yet, at the end of it all, the human beings who are the subject of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights continue to be afflicted by wars and violent conflicts. 
They have, as yet, not attained their freedom from fear of death that would be brought about by the use of weapons of mass destruction as well as conventional arms. … 
This is probably the last time I will have the honour to stand at this podium to address the General Assembly. 
Born as the First World War came to a close and departing from public life as the world marks half-a-century of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I have reached that part of the long walk when the opportunity is granted, as it should be to all men and women, to retire to some rest and tranquillity in the village of my birth. 
As I sit in Qunu and grow as ancient as its hills, I will continue to entertain the hope that there has emerged a cadre of leaders in my own country and region, on my continent and in the world, which will not allow that any should be denied their freedom as we were; that any should be turned into refugees as we were; that any should be condemned to go hungry as we were; 
that any should be stripped of their human dignity as we were. ... 
Were all these hopes to translate into a realisable dream and not a nightmare to torment the soul of the aged, then will I, indeed, have peace and tranquillity. 
Then would history and the billions throughout the world proclaim that it was right that we dreamt and that we toiled to give life to a workable dream. 
Address to the United Nations General Assembly, 21 September 1998 
Peace is not just the absence of conflict; 
peace is the creation of an environment where all can flourish, regardless of race, colour, creed, religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of difference. 
Religion, ethnicity, language, social and cultural practices are elements which enrich human civilization, adding to the wealth of our diversity. 
Why should they be allowed to become a cause of division, and violence? 
We demean our common humanity by allowing that to happen. ... 
New Delhi, India, 31 January 2004 
There is still too much discord, hatred, division, conflict and violence in our world here at the beginning of the 21st century. 
A fundamental concern for others in our individual and community lives would go a long way in making the world the better place we so passionately dreamt of. … 
It is so easy to break down and destroy. 
The heroes are those who make peace and build. ... 
Soweto, South Africa, 12 July 2008 
South Africans have shown a tremendous capacity to join hands when facing difficulty. 
The apartheid system eventually fell because of the unity of those who were denied their rights, and because all sectors of society recognised that they had more to gain from working together than from fighting each other. 
It is that same quality that has helped us, so quickly, to lay the foundations for a better life. 
When apartheid ended we faced the difficult task of reconstructing our shattered society and providing the most basic of services for our people. We had to build schools and hospitals, to provide housing and jobs, to boost our economy, to protect our people's rights through our Constitution and our courts, to help South Africa deal with the division of its past and start the healing process, to deal with abuse and damage which engulfed most of our communities. 
Essentially our task was to create the conditions in which every South African has the opportunity to create a better life for themselves. 
But government cannot meet these challenges by itself. 
It requires of us all to pull together, into a partnership, in order to bring about the necessary changes. 
In order to achieve these goals, we also needed to transform government from a system serving minority interests to one that meets the needs of all South Africans. 
And all these things had to be done in a country where most people were denied experience of government or proper education and training. 
This is why we have placed aheavy emphasis on building capacity in government. … 
When we say that the best solutions to these challenges can only be found when we work with each other, it requires a commitment of each and every one of us. 
Today we should all ask ourselves: What have I done to improve the surroundings in which I live? Do I litter or do I protect my surroundings? 
Do I spread racial hatred or do I promote peace and reconciliation? 
Do I buy stolen goods or do I help reduce crime? 
Do I pay my dues or do I cheat on my taxes, service fees and licences? 
Do I expect everything to be delivered to me or do I work with my local councillors to create a better life for myself and my community? 
Bothaville, South Africa, 14 October 1998 
As long as poverty, injustice and gross inequality persist in our world, none of us can truly rest. 
We shall never forget how millions of people around the world joined us in solidarity to fight the injustice of our oppression while we were incarcerated. 
Those efforts paid off and we are able to stand here and join the millions around the world in support of freedom against poverty. 
Massive poverty and obscene inequality are such terrible scourges of our times — times in which the world boasts breathtaking advances in science, technology, industry and wealth accumulation. 
We live in a world where knowledge and information have made enormous strides, yet millions of children are not in school. 
We live in a world where the AIDS pandemic threatens the very fabric of our lives. 
Yet we spend more money on weapons than on ensuring treatment and support for the millions infected by HIV. 
It is a world of great promise and hope. It is also a world of despair, disease and hunger. 
Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. 
It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life. 
While poverty persists, there is no true freedom. 
The steps that are needed from the developed nations are clear. 
The first is ensuring trade justice. 
I have said before that trade justice is a truly meaningful way for the developed countries to show commitment to bringing about an end to global poverty. 
The second is an end to the debt crisis for the poor countries. 
The third is to deliver much more aid and make sure it is of the highest quality. ...

In the enabling resolutions establishing the Peacebuilding Commission, resolution 60/180 and resolution 1645 (2005) of 20 December 2005, the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council mandated it: 
to bring together all relevant actors to marshal resources and to advise on and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict peacebuilding and recovery; 
to focus attention on the reconstruction and institution-building efforts necessary for recovery from conflict and to support the development of integrated strategies in order to lay the foundation for sustainable development; 
to provide recommendations and information to improve the coordination of all relevant actors within and outside the United Nations, to develop best practices, to help to ensure predictable financing for early recovery activities and to extend the period of attention given by the international community to postconflict

Structure & membership 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon addresses PBC, 27 June 2007. 
The PBC operates in three principal configurations to marshal resources at the disposal of the international community and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict peacebuilding in countries emerging from conflict: 
With assistance from the Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO), the configurations bring together the United Nations' broad capacities and experiences in conflict prevention, mediation, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, reconstruction, the promotion of human rights and the rule of law, and long-term sustainable development assistance. 
Civil Society Engagement 
Civil society may engage with the PBC and its related activities in a variety of ways. 
At UN headquarters, civil society organizations are encouraged to attend meetings of the Commission and may informally contribute to the PBC's work by providing written submissions to the PBC members and the Peacebuilding Support Office. 
Civil society organizations may also participate in certain meetings of the PBC country-specific configurations, often called NGO informal briefings. 
In countries receiving advice from the Commission, national and local civil society organizations are encouraged to engage in national consultations on the peacebuilding frameworks. 
Civil society representatives may also periodically participate in meetings of the PBC and serve as members of the Joint Steering Committees, which oversees the Peacebuilding Fund.

In the enabling resolutions establishing the Peacebuilding Commission, resolutions 60/180 and 1645 (2005) of 20 December 2005, the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council decided a country can be included on the PBC's agenda via: 
Requests for advice from the Security Council; 
Requests for advice from the ECOSOC or the General Assembly with the consent of a concerned Member State in exceptional circumstances on the verge of lapsing or relapsing into conflict and with which the Security Council is not seized; 
Requests for advice from Member States in exceptional circumstances on the verge of lapsing or relapsing into conflict and which are not on the agenda of the Security Council; 
Requests for advice from the Secretary-General. 
The Commission is likely to deal only with countries emerging from conflict, once a peace accord has been concluded and a minimum degree of security exists. 
Countries would be expected to express an interest in appearing before the PBC. A referral against the wish of the Government is unlikely to take place. 
At present, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, Central African Republic, Guinea and Liberia are on the agenda of the Commission.

2010 Review - United Nations Peacebuilding Commission 
"The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission in 2005 was seen as a groundbreaking step, holding new promise for the populations of countries emerging from conflict. 
Five years later, despite committed and dedicated efforts, the hopes that accompanied the founding resolutions have yet to be realized. We are now at a 
crossroads: either there is a conscious recommitment to peacebuilding at the very heart of the work of the United Nations, or the Peacebuilding Commission settles into the limited role that has developed so far. 
Our consultations suggest that the membership strongly favours the former path".

Secretary-General's Messages - United Nations Public Service Day - 23 June 
On the annual observance of Public Service Day, we honour those who accept the responsibilities of service to humanity and who contribute to excellence and innovation in public service institutions. 
For the first time, Public Service Day will be commemorated in Africa. 
At a ceremony in Dar-Es Salaam, the United Nations will pay tribute to public servants from all over the world and acknowledge public service institutions for their achievements. 
Governments and good governance play a central role in addressing the complex challenges of our times. 
Whether it is climate change, the economic crisis, unemployment, health pandemics, or poverty eradication, public servants and good governance are often the first line of defence. 
Implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, also relies heavily on the work of public servants – their leadership, their capacities, their innovations in the delivery of vital services. 
The winners of the 2011 United Nations Public Service Awards embody the essential building blocks of good governance: integrity, citizen participation, respect for diversity and gender equality, and effective knowledge management, particularly through the use of modern technologies. 
I commend the winners for their commitment to their countries and communities. 
I encourage all public servants from around the world to work in that same spirit and strive for greater impact in their important work of building a better life for all.

Operators 
To enter a query, type in a few descriptive words and press the Enter key or click the Go button for a list of relevant results. 
The UN search engine uses sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages that are both important and relevant to your search. For instance, it analyzes not 
only the candidate page, but also the pages linking into it to determine the value of the candidate page for your search. 
The UN Search also prefers pages in which your query terms are near each other. 
Note: 
Encrypted, viewable PDF documents are converted to HTML for indexing; 
however, the HTML is not displayed. 
The UN standard is UK English. British spelling is used (i.e. colour, labour, programme). 
A single spelling suggestion is returned with the results for queries where the spell checker has detected a possible spelling mistake. 
The spell checker feature is context sensitive. 
submitted is "gail divers," "gail devers" is suggested as an alternative query. However, "scuba divers" would not return an alternate query suggestion. 
Currently, the spell checker supports only US English. 
Synonyms are other words that have the same or similar meanings. 
They are displayed as "Other suggested searches" on the results page.

The Advanced Search: customizing search results 
To enter a query, type in a few descriptive words in the keyword box provided. 
You can then customize your search query by making use of the various options available on the Advanced Search page as outlined below: 
You can select one of three options to match all the keywords you have entered in the keyword box, or any of the words you have entered, or you can request the search engine to retrieve the exact phrase 
Area: You can search the entire site or limit your search to any one of the areas listed in the drop down menu: News, Press Releases, Global Issues, Economic and Social Affairs or International Law. 
Limit by Language: 
You can limit your search to any one of the six UN official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish). 
For Arabic you must enter the keyword(s) in Arabic. 
While this is not necessary for the other languages, better search results are obtained if you enter keywords in the language that you want to limit the search to. 
Additionally, the United Nations uses the British spelling of English words and Simplified Chinese. 
Limit by Date: 
You can request Web pages that were updated in the past 3 months, 6 months, year or anytime. 
Limit by File Type: 
You can limit your search results to Web pages (.html, .htm, .asp, .shtml, or .nsf) Adobe Acrobat PDF files, Microsoft WORD files (.doc) or Microsoft PowerPoint files (.ppt). 
Viewing results: You can view the results of your search 10 at a time or in groupings of 25, 50, 75, or 100. 
Once you have customized your search query press the Enter key or click the Go button for a list of relevant results. 
The Sort by Date feature sorts and presents your search results based on date. 
The date of each file is returned in the results. 
Results that do not contain dates are displayed at the end, sorted by relevance. 
Automatic "and" Queries 
By default, the UN search engine only returns pages that include all of your search terms. 
There is no need to include "and" between terms. 
search for security council resolutions, enter: 
To broaden or restrict the search, include fewer or more terms. 
The UN search engine supports the logical "OR" operator. 
To retrieve pages that include either word A or word B, use an uppercase "OR" between terms. 
example, to search for a United Nations Information Centre (UNIC) office in either Buenos Aires or Rio, enter: 
Every search result lists one or more excerpts from the web page to display how your search terms are used in context on that page. 
excerpt, your search terms are displayed in bold text so that you can quickly determine if that result is from a page you want to visit. 
Matter? 
Searches are not case sensitive. 
All letters, regardless of how you enter them, are understood as lower case. 
searches for "kofi annan," "Kofi Annan," and "Kofi annan" all return the same results. 
The UN search engine ignores common words and characters known as stop words. 
These include most pronouns and articles. 
It automatically disregards such terms as "where" and "how," as well as certain single digits and single letters. 
These terms rarely help to narrow a search and can significantly slow searching. 
If you want to use stop words in your search, use the "+" sign or enclose your phrase containing stop words in quotation marks. 
you include a space before the "+" sign. 
For example, to search for Repertory +of practice: 
You can also include the "+" sign in phrase searches. 
To provide the most accurate results, the UN Search engine does not use "stemming" or support "wildcard" searches. 
Rather, it searches for exactly the words that you enter into the search box. 
For example, searching for "specialized agenc" or "specialized agenc*" will not yield "specialized agency" or "specialized agencies.". 
If in doubt, try both forms, for example: "specialized agency" and 
"specialized agencies." Refining Your Search 
Since the UN Search engine only returns web pages that contain all of the words in your query, refining or narrowing your search is as simple as adding more words to the search terms you have already entered. 
returns a specific subset of the pages that were returned by your original broad query. 
You can exclude a word from your search by putting a minus sign ("-") immediately in front of the term you want to exclude. 
include a space before the minus sign. 
For example, the search: will return pages about climate that do not contain the word "investment." 
Phrase Searches 
You can search for phrases by adding quotation marks. 
Words enclosed in double quotes ("like this") appear together in all returned documents. 
Phrase searches using quotation marks are useful when searching for famous sayings or specific names. 
Certain characters serve as phrase connectors. 
Phrase connectors work like quotes because they join your search words in the same way double quotes join your search words. 
For example, the use of a hyphen in the search: is treated as a phrase search even though the search words are not enclosed in double quotes. 
The UN search engine recognizes hyphens, slashes, periods, equal signs, and apostrophes as phrase connectors. 
You may also narrow searches by restricting queries in certain ways. 
Restrict Type 
Example 
to a given location on your site 
Operators for details 
to specific domains 
to specific file types like excel spreadsheets, pdf 
Directory Restricting 
To restrict the directories searched, enter a URL that drills down through the directory structure to the directories or files to be searched. 
example, the query [un.org/News/] restricts the search to everything at the manual level. 
If the trailing slash is not included, as in [un.org/News], then all subdirectories are also searched. 
The UN search engine supports several advanced operators, which are query words with 
special functions. 
A list of the advanced operators with explanation are provided below. 
The search engine keeps the text of the many documents it crawls available in a backed-up format known as "cache." 
A cached version of a web page can be retrieved if the original page is unavailable (for example, the page's server is down). 
page appears exactly as it looked when the crawler last crawled it and includes a message (at the top of the page) to indicate that it's a cached version of the page. 
The query [cache:] shows the cached version of the web page. 
instance, [cache:www.un.org] shows the cached page of UN's homepage. 
There can be no space between cache: and the web page URL in the query. 
If you include other words in the query, those words will be highlighted within the cached document. 
For instance, [cache:www.un.org press 
releases] shows the cached content with the words "press" and "releases" highlighted. 
The query [info:] returns all information available for that particular URL. 
For instance, [info:www.un.org] shows information about the UN homepage. 
Note there can be no space between the info: and the web page URL. 
If you include [site:] in your query, the results are restricted to those websites in the given domain. 
For instance, [help site:www.un.org] finds pages about help within www.un.org. 
[help site:org] finds pages about help within .org URLs. 
There can be no space between the "site:" and the domain. 
The query [link:] enables you to restrict your search to all pages that have links to the query page. 
To do this, use the [link:www.un.org/peace/] syntax in the search box. 
terms can be specified when using this special query term. 
For example, to find all Web pages in the UN Web site that have links to the main page of the UN Peace and Security site www.un.org/peace, enter: 
If you start a query with [allintitle:], the results are restricted to documents with all of the query words in the document's HTML title. 
For example, [allintitle: 
dialogue among civilizations] only returns documents that have "dialogue", "among" and "civilizations" in the HTML title. 
If you include [intitle:] in your query, the search is restricted to results with documents containing that word in the HTML title. 
For example, [intitle:un indigenous] returns documents that mention the word "un" in their HTML title, and mention the word "indigenous" anywhere in the document either in the title or anywhere else in the document. 
Note: There can be no space between the "intitle:" and the following word. 
Putting [intitle:] in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting [allintitle:] at the front of your query. 
example, [intitle:un intitle:indigenous] is the same as [allintitle: 
If you start a query with [allinurl:], the search is restricted to results with all of the query words in the URL. 
example, [allinurl: 
un indigenous] returns only documents that have both "un" and "indigenous" in the URL. 
[allinurl:] works on words, not URL components. 
particular, it ignores punctuation. 
Thus, [allinurl: 
Depts/dhl] restricts the results to page with the words "Depts" and "dhl" in the URL, but doesn't require that they be separated by a slash within that URL, that they be adjacent, or that they be in that particular word order. 
currently no way to enforce these constraints. 
If you include [inurl:] in your query, the results are restricted to documents containing that word in the URL. 
example, [inurl:un search] returns documents that mention the word "un" in their URL and mention the word "search" anywhere in the document either in the URL or anywhere else in the document. 
Note: There can be no space between the "inurl:" and the following word. 
[inurl:] works on words, not URL components. 
particular, it ignores punctuation. 
Thus, in the query [un inurl:Dets/dhl], the inurl: 
"Depts," which is the single word following the inurl: operator, and does not affect the word "dhl." 
The query [un inurl:Depts inurl:dhl] can be used to require both "Depts" and "dhl" to be in the URL. 
Putting [inurl:] in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting [allinurl:] at the front of your query. 
example, [inurl:un inurl:search] is the same as [allinurl: un search].

Peace and Democracy: Make your voice heard! 
Each year the International Day of Peace is observed around the world on 21 September. 
The General Assembly has declared this as a day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and peoples. 
This year - on its 30th anniversary - the Day's theme is "Peace and Democracy: make your voice heard". 
The Preamble to the United Nations Charter states that the Organization was founded to prevent and resolve international conflicts and help build a culture of peace in the world. 
Peace and democracy are inextricably linked. Together, they form a partnership that promotes the well-being of all. 
Embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, democracy supports an environment for a host of political rights and civil liberties. 
In line with the Day's theme, something profoundly remarkable is happening in the world. 
Young women and men everywhere are demonstrating the power of solidarity by reaching out and rallying together for the common goal of dignity and human rights. 
This powerful force brings with it the potential to create a peaceful and democratic future. 
Add your voice! 
There are many ways to participate in democratic practices, including taking part in dialogue on constitutional processes, advocating for civil society empowerment, joining the struggle for gender equality and against discrimination, engaging in civic education and promoting voter registration. 
The International Day of Peace offers people globally, a shared date to organize events and undertake deeds celebrating the importance of peace and democracy in realistic and useful ways.

Youth for Peace and Development 
The International Day of Peace, observed each year on 21 September, is a global call for ceasefire and non-violence. 
This year, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is calling on young people around the world to take a stand for peace under the theme, Youth for Peace and Development. 
UNMIT / UN Photo 
The United Nations is looking for stories from young people around the world who are working for peace. 
The campaign slogan this year is Peace=Future, The math is easy. " 
This year, the International Day of Peace (IDP) falls within the same time period as a major summit on the Millennium Development Goals, the world's largest anti-poverty campaign. 
The Summit brings world leaders together at the United Nations in New York from 20 - 22 September. 
In addition, the UN General Assembly has proclaimed 2010 as International Year of Youth: Dialogue and Mutual Understanding. 
A campaign to be launched by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) on 12 August will promote the ideals of respect for human rights and solidarity across generations, cultures, religions, and civilizations. 
Those are key elements that reinforce the foundations of a sustainable peace. 
Youth, peace and development are closely interlinked: Peace enables development, which is critical in providing opportunities for young people, particularly those in countries emerging from conflict. 
Healthy, educated youth are in turn crucial to sustainable development and peace. 
Peace, stability and security are essential to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, aimed at slashing poverty, hunger, disease, and maternal and child death by 2015. 
The Secretary-General has recognized the incredible potential of youth which must be tapped to ensure these goals are met in their lifetimes. 
Each year, the Secretary-General, his Messengers of Peace, the entire UN system and many individuals, groups and organizations around the world use the Day of Peace to engage in activities that contribute to ceasefires, end conflict, bridge cultural divides and create tolerance. 
On 13 June 2010, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the 100-day countdown to the International Day of Peace, calling on young people around the world to submit their stories via social media, detailing what they do for peace. 
Watch this space for some of those stories. 
The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by resolution 36/67 of the United Nations General Assembly to coincide with its opening session, which was held annually on the third Tuesday of September. 
The first Peace Day was observed in September 1982. 
In 2001, the General Assembly by unanimous vote adopted resolution 55/282, which established 21 September as an annual day of non-violence and cease-fire. 
The UN invites all nations and people to honour a cessation of hostilities during the Day, and to otherwise commemorate the Day through education and public awareness on issues related to peace.

Disarmament and non-proliferation 
The International Day of Peace, observed each year on 21 September, is a global call for ceasefire and non-violence. 
This year the Secretary-General is calling on governments and citizens to focus on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. 
On 13 June 2009, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched a multiplatform campaign under the slogan WMD – We Must Disarm to mark the 100-day countdown which lead to the International Day of Peace on 21 September. 
The United Nations will continue to raise awareness of the dangers and costs of nuclear weapons, and on why nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are so crucial. 
The Secretary-General was joined in the campaign by United Nations Messenger of Peace Michael Douglas, who has championed the cause of disarmament for the United Nations since 1998, and American actor Rainn Wilson, featured in the TV series The Office. 
The International Day of Peace was established by the UN General Assembly in 1981 for "commemorating and strengthening the ideals of peace within and among all nations and people." 
Twenty years later, the General Assembly decided that 21 September would be observed annually as a "day of global ceasefire and non-violence" and invited all Member States, organizations and individuals to commemorate the day, including through education and public awareness, and to cooperate with the United Nations in the establishment of a global ceasefire.

The General Assembly, in resolution 55/282, of 7 September 2001, decided that, beginning in 2002, the International Day of Peace should be observed on 21 September each year. 
The Assembly declared that the Day be observed as a day of global ceasefire and non-violence, an invitation to all nations and people to honour a cessation of hostilities during the Day.

International Day of Peace 2003 
General Assembly, in resolution 55/282 (PDF), of 7 September 2001, decided 
that, beginning in 2002, the International Day of Peace should be observed on 21 September each year. 
It invited all Member States, organizations of the United Nations system, regional and non-governmental organizations and individuals 
to commemorate the Day in an appropriate manner, including through education and public awareness, and to cooperate with the United Nations in establishing a global ceasefire. "There is special poignancy and purpose in this year's observance of the International Day of Peace. 
The troubling events of the last year -- the conflicts, violence and hatred, the bomb attack on the United Nations itself in Baghdad, the deep divisions among states -- have raised fundamental questions about the efforts of the international community to promote peace and well-being for all the world's people."

About DESA - United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 
NGO Meeting Place 
DESA continues to enhance dialogue between more than 3,000 NGOs from around the world and the UN system. 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
DESA's active support has encouraged more and more countries to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
The Convention is intended to protect and promote the universal human rights of the world's estimated 650 million people living with disabilities (80 percent of whom live in developing countries). 
Addressing Climate Change 
To curb the effects of climate change, DESA's Division for Sustainable Development is advocating a 'Global Green New Deal' that encourages the increased production and affordability of renewable energy in the developing world. 
Advancing the Global Statistical System 
DESA's Statistics Division continues to facilitate the development of the global statistical system. 
Global population figures, prepared by the Population Division at DESA, provide the world with a road-map of the demographic challenges to development in the years ahead. 
The Global Economic Situation 
Since 1948, the Development Policy and Analysis Division in DESA and its predecessors have been monitoring the state of the world economy. 
The Division assists with the production of the World Economic and Social Survey (WESS) and the World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP). 
Promoting Public Service Innovation 
DESA's Division for Public Administration and Development Management convenes the UN Public Service Awards to promote and support innovations in public service delivery worldwide. 
In 2009, the UN Forum on Forests adopted a landmark resolution which sets out a clear roadmap to address challenges related to mobilizing financing for sustainable forest management. 
The 2008 Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, organized by the Financing for Development Office in DESA, adopted the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development, which addressed new challenges and emerging issues including climate change, food and energy prices volatility and the impact of the current financial and economic crisis on development. 
Sustainability Projects in Developing Countries 
Villages across Timor-Leste are using solar powered lights and saving money thanks to a DESA initiative. 
The programme helped East Timorese to switch from traditional lighting sources to one more environmentally sustainable. 
Meeting Development Goals 
The United Nations Development Agenda, including the Millennium Development Goals, is assessed and reviewed by ECOSOC's Annual Ministerial Review and the Development Cooperation Forum, both of which are facilitated by DESA's Office for ECOSOC Support and Coordination. 
Indigenous Equality 
The Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues recently called the world's attention to the forced labour and general suffering endured by the indigenous peoples in the Chaco regions of Bolivia and Paraguay. 
A Sustainable Tomorrow 
At the 2009 Commission on Sustainable Development, supported by DESA's Division of Sustainable Development, around 1,000 participants from around the world negotiated a 52-page outcome document which broke new ground on how the global community will promote sustainable agriculture. 
Responding to the Economic Crisis 
The 2009 Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, organized by the President of the General Assembly with support from Financing for Development Office in DESA, resulted in a global consensus on the causes, impacts and responses to the crisis in an inclusive, coordinated and comprehensive manner. 
DESA continues to push for increased internet access for the people of the developing world, especially those in Africa and Arab states. 
Social Progress 
Each year the Commission for Social Development, supported by DESA's Division for Social Policy and Development, follows-up the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action by promoting full employment, decent work and the eradication of poverty. 
Technology for All 
A joint project of DESA and the Government of Spain, recently injected millions of dollars into small island developing states to provide them with better access to technology. 
Our Work: 
The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and its predecessors have helped countries around the world meet their economic, social and environmental challenges for more than 50 years. 
DESA's mission - to promote development for all - reflects a fundamental concern for equity and equality in countries large and small, developed and developing. 
Within the framework of the United Nations Development Agenda, DESA works on issues ranging from poverty reduction, population, gender equality and indigenous rights to macroeconomic policy, development finance, public sector innovation, forest policy, climate change and sustainable development. 
The Department also supports the effort to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, a set of time-bound targets, which put the eradication of poverty at the centre of the global partnership for development. 
At the United Nations, DESA provides the substantive support to intergovernmental processes on development issues in the General Assembly and in the Economic and Social Council, its functional commissions and expert bodies. 
DESA engages with a variety of stakeholders around the world, including non-governmental organizations, civil society, the private sector, research and academic organizations and intergovernmental organizations, as well as our partner organizations in the United Nations system. 
Our work takes many forms. 
DESA: 
Analyzes, generates and compiles a wide range of data and information on development issues. 
Brings together the international community to address economic and social challenges at conferences and summits. 
Supports the formulation of development policies, global standards and norms. 
Monitors and supports the implementation of international agreements. 
Assists nation states address their development challenges through engaging in a variety of capacity development initiatives. 
Based at United Nations Headquarters in New York City, DESA has 9 Divisions, each of which performs a critical function in promoting development, together with our Capacity Development Office. 
DESA also collaborates closely with its partners at regional and country levels in helping countries to formulate and implement national development strategies. 
DESA by numbers: 
On the research and analytical front, DESA's top priority is to maximize the impact of its flagship publications and major intergovernmental reports on national and international policy-making. 
Every year, we prepare some 300 documents and 300 publications that analyze a wide range of development issues, which are distributed in print and electronic format around the world. 
DESA has supported more than 35 major summits and conferences since 1990 on issues ranging from sustainable development and the advancement of women to the global economic crisis, financing for development and the ageing of the global population. 
The Development Account, a fund established by the General Assembly and co-managed by DESA, has implemented more than 150 development projects around the world since 1997. 
In the year 2000, United Nations Member states agreed to 8 Millennium Development Goals to be achieved by 2015, with the global progress monitored by DESA in its annual Millennium Development Goals Report, as well as the Report of the MDG Gap Task Force.
